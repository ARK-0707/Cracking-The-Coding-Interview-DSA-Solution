# 8.1 Triple Step

## Problem Description
A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

### Approach
This problem can be solved using recursion, dynamic programming (with memoization), or an iterative approach. We'll focus on two methods: a basic recursive solution and an optimized recursive solution with memoization.

1. **Recursive Solution**:
   - If there are 0 steps left, there is exactly 1 way (by standing still).
   - If there are fewer than 0 steps, there are 0 ways to climb.
   - Otherwise, the total number of ways to climb `n` steps is the sum of the ways to climb `(n-1)` steps, `(n-2)` steps, and `(n-3)` steps.

2. **Optimized Recursive Solution with Memoization**:
   - In the recursive approach, the same subproblems are solved multiple times, leading to redundant computations.
   - By storing the results of subproblems in a dictionary (memo), we can reuse them to improve efficiency.

### Recursive Solution Code

```python
def stairSteps(n):
    """
    Count the number of ways to climb a staircase with n steps using recursion.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case: One way to climb 0 steps (stand still)
    if n < 0:
        return 0  # No way to climb negative steps
    
    # Recursively sum the ways to climb (n-1), (n-2), and (n-3) steps
    return stairSteps(n - 1) + stairSteps(n - 2) + stairSteps(n - 3)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 4
    print(f"Number of ways to climb {n} steps: {stairSteps(n)}")
```

### Optimized Recursive Solution with Memoization Code

```python
def stairStepsMemo(n, memo={}):
    """
    Count the number of ways to climb a staircase with n steps using recursion and memoization.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case: One way to climb 0 steps
    if n < 0:
        return 0  # No way to climb negative steps
    
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]  # Return precomputed result
    
    # Compute and store the result in the memo dictionary
    memo[n] = stairStepsMemo(n - 1, memo) + stairStepsMemo(n - 2, memo) + stairStepsMemo(n - 3, memo)
    return memo[n]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 4
    print(f"Number of ways to climb {n} steps (memoized): {stairStepsMemo(n)}")
```

### Explanation

#### Recursive Solution
1. **Base Cases**:
   - When `n == 0`: The child is already at the top, so there's 1 way (stand still).
   - When `n < 0`: It's impossible to have a negative number of steps, so there are 0 ways.

2. **Recursive Formula**:
   - For `n > 0`, the total ways to climb `n` steps is the sum of:
     - Ways to climb `n-1` steps (a single hop),
     - Ways to climb `n-2` steps (a double hop),
     - Ways to climb `n-3` steps (a triple hop).

#### Memoized Solution
1. **Avoiding Redundant Computations**:
   - In the recursive solution, the same subproblems are solved multiple times. For example, computing `stairSteps(2)` when solving for `stairSteps(4)` and `stairSteps(3)`.
   - Using a memoization dictionary, we store the result of each subproblem after it's computed, ensuring that each subproblem is solved only once.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - This approach resembles a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where the result of each smaller subproblem is used to build the solution for larger problems.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Recursive Solution
- **Time Complexity**: O($`3^n`$), since each call branches into three more calls. This exponential growth makes the approach inefficient for larger values of `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the call stack in the recursion.

#### Memoized Solution
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), since each subproblem is solved exactly once and stored in the memo dictionary.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the memoization dictionary and the recursion stack.

### Example

#### Input:
```
n = 4
```

#### Recursive Solution Output:
```
Number of ways to climb 4 steps: 7
```

#### Memoized Solution Output:
```
Number of ways to climb 4 steps (memoized): 7
```

### Visual Representation of the Problem (n = 4)

- **Recursive Tree**:
  ```
  stairSteps(4)
    ├── stairSteps(3)
    │     ├── stairSteps(2)
    │     │     ├── stairSteps(1)
    │     │     │     ├── stairSteps(0) → 1
    │     │     │     └── stairSteps(-1) → 0
    │     │     └── stairSteps(0) → 1
    │     ├── stairSteps(1)
    │     └── stairSteps(0) → 1
    └── ...
  ```

- **Memoized Tree**:
  ```
  stairStepsMemo(4)
    ├── stairStepsMemo(3) → memoized
    ├── stairStepsMemo(2) → memoized
    └── stairStepsMemo(1) → memoized
  ```

This optimization reduces redundant computations, making the solution efficient even for large `n`.
