# 8.2 Robot in a Grid

## Problem Description
Imagine a robot sitting in the upper left corner of grid with `r` rows and `c` columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are **"off limits"** such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left corner to the bottom right.

---

## Approach
This problem can be solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The goal is to determine whether a valid path exists by building a table (`dp`) that tracks whether each cell in the grid is reachable.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D DP table (`dp`) of the same size as the grid.
   - Mark all cells as `False` initially, indicating they are not reachable.

2. **Handle the Destination**:
   - If the bottom-right cell (`'F'`) is blocked (`'X'`), immediately return `False` as no valid path can exist.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Start from the bottom-right corner and move upwards and leftwards.
   - A cell `(i, j)` is reachable if:
     - It is not blocked (`grid[i][j] != 'X'`).
     - At least one of its neighboring cells (`dp[i+1][j]` or `dp[i][j+1]`) is reachable.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Check the value at the top-left corner of the DP table (`dp[0][0]`). If it is `True`, a path exists; otherwise, it does not.

## Code Implementation

```python
def path_with_dp(grid):
    """
    Determines if a path exists for the robot from the top-left to bottom-right corner.
    """
    r, c = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[False for _ in range(c)] for _ in range(r)]  # DP table

    # If the bottom-right cell is blocked, no path exists
    if grid[r - 1][c - 1] == 'X':
        return False

    # Start by marking the destination as reachable
    dp[r - 1][c - 1] = True

    # Fill the DP table bottom-up
    for i in range(r - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(c - 1, -1, -1):
            if grid[i][j] == 'X':
                continue  # Skip blocked cells
            
            # Check if the cell to the right or below is reachable
            if i + 1 < r and dp[i + 1][j]:
                dp[i][j] = True
            if j + 1 < c and dp[i][j + 1]:
                dp[i][j] = True

    # Return whether the start cell is reachable
    return dp[0][0]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    grid = [
        ['R', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O'],
        ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
        ['O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O'],
        ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
        ['O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'F'],
    ]

    isPath = path_with_dp(grid)

    if isPath:
        print("Path Found!!")
    else:
        print("Path not found!!")
```

## Explanation

### Grid Representation
- **`'R'`**: Robot's starting position (top-left corner).
- **`'F'`**: Robot's final destination (bottom-right corner).
- **`'X'`**: Blocked cells that the robot cannot step on.
- **`'O'`**: Open cells the robot can move through.

### Algorithm Steps

#### 1. **Creating the DP Table**
- A 2D list (`dp`) of the same size as the grid is initialized, with all values set to `False`.
- The bottom-right cell (`'F'`) is initially marked as reachable (`dp[r-1][c-1] = True`).

#### 2. **Filling the Table**
- Start from the bottom-right corner and iterate backwards to the top-left.
- For each cell `(i, j)`, check its neighbors:
  - If the cell below (`dp[i+1][j]`) or the cell to the right (`dp[i][j+1]`) is reachable, mark the current cell as reachable.
- Skip any blocked cells (`grid[i][j] == 'X'`).

#### 3. **Result**
- The value of `dp[0][0]` determines whether the robot can reach the destination:
  - `True`: A valid path exists.
  - `False`: No valid path exists.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:
- **O(r * c)**: Every cell in the grid is visited once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(r * c)**: The DP table requires additional space equivalent to the grid.

## Example Walkthrough

### Input Grid
```
grid = [
    ['R', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'O'],
    ['O', 'X', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
    ['O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'O'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],
    ['O', 'O', 'X', 'O', 'F'],
]
```

### DP Table (Bottom-Up Filling)

#### Step 1: Initialize DP Table
```
dp = [
    [False, False, False, False, False],
    [False, False, False, False, False],
    [False, False, False, False, False],
    [False, False, False, False, False],
    [False, False, False, False, True],  # Destination cell is reachable
]
```

#### Step 2: Fill DP Table
- Mark cells reachable from the bottom-right corner by working upwards and leftwards.

Final DP Table:
```
dp = [
    [True, True, False, False, False],
    [True, False, False, False, False],
    [True, True, False, False, False],
    [False, True, True, True, False],
    [False, False, False, True, True],
]
```

### Output
- **Result**: `dp[0][0] = True`, so the robot can reach the destination.
- **Message**: `"Path Found!!"`

---

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(r * c), as each cell is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(r * c), due to the DP table.

This solution is efficient and scalable, allowing the robot to find a valid path in grids with obstacles efficiently.
