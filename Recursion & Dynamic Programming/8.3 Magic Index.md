# 8.3 Magic Index

## Problem Description
A **magic index** in an array `A[0...n-1]` is defined as an index such that **`A[i] = i`**. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, design a method to find the magic index, if one exists.

---

## Approach
We can solve this problem using a **linear search** or an optimized approach like **binary search**. Since the array is sorted, binary search is more efficient for larger arrays. Below, we implement a **linear search** for simplicity.

### Steps for Linear Search:
1. Traverse the array from left to right.
2. For each index `i`, check if `A[i] == i`.
3. If a magic index is found, return it immediately.
4. If no magic index is found after traversing the entire array, return `None`.

---

## Code Implementation

### Linear Search Code

```python
def magicIndex(array):
    """
    Finds a magic index in the given array (if it exists) using linear search.

    :param array: List of sorted distinct integers.
    :return: The magic index if it exists, otherwise None.
    """
    for i in range(len(array)):
        if array[i] == i:  # Check if the value matches its index
            return i
    return None


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Input array of sorted distinct integers
    A = [-10, -5, 2, 5, 10, 12]
    
    # Find the magic index
    result = magicIndex(A)

    if result is None:
        print("No magic index found!!")
    else:
        print(f"The magic index for the array is: {result}")
```

## Explanation

### Key Properties of the Problem
1. The array is **sorted**, which allows potential use of binary search for optimization.
2. **Distinct integers** ensure no duplicates, simplifying the checks for `A[i] == i`.

### Algorithm Walkthrough
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start iterating from the first element of the array.
   
2. **Magic Index Check**:
   - For each index `i`, compare the value of the element `A[i]` with the index itself.
   - If `A[i] == i`, a magic index is found, and the function immediately returns `i`.

3. **Termination**:
   - If no magic index is found by the end of the array, the function returns `None`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity:
- **Linear Search**: O(n), where `n` is the size of the array.
  - This involves checking every element in the array.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: No additional space is used other than a few variables.

---

## Example Walkthrough

### Input Array
```
A = [-10, -5, 2, 5, 10, 12]
```

### Steps:

1. Start at index 0:
   - `A[0] = -10` ≠ `0`.

2. Move to index 1:
   - `A[1] = -5` ≠ `1`.

3. Move to index 2:
   - `A[2] = 2` = `2` → Magic index found!

4. The function returns `2`.

### Output
```
"The magic index for the array is: 2"
```

## Limitations and Optimizations

### Limitation of Linear Search:
- Inefficient for large arrays due to O(n) complexity.

### Optimization via Binary Search:
For large arrays, binary search can reduce the time complexity to O(log n). Binary search takes advantage of the sorted property by eliminating half of the search space at every step.

#### Binary Search Approach:
- Compare `A[mid]` with `mid`.
  - If `A[mid] == mid`, return `mid` (magic index found).
  - If `A[mid] > mid`, recursively search the left half (`A[low]...A[mid-1]`).
  - If `A[mid] < mid`, recursively search the right half (`A[mid+1]...A[high]`).

---

### Example with Binary Search

#### Input:
```
A = [-10, -5, 2, 5, 10, 12]
```

#### Binary Search Steps:
1. Start with the full range `[low = 0, high = 5]`.
2. Compute `mid = (0 + 5) // 2 = 2`:
   - `A[2] = 2`, and `2 == 2` → Magic index found!

#### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) (due to recursive calls).

This optimization significantly improves performance for larger arrays.
