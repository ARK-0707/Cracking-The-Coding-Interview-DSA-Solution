# 8.6 Towers of Hanoi

## Problem Description:
In the classic problem of the **Towers of Hanoi**, you have `3` towers and `N` disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:

    1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    2. A disk can only be moved to the top of another tower.
    3. A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk.

---

## Approach:

### Using Recursive Function and Tower Class:
1. **Tower Class**:
   - Represents a tower with a name and a stack of disks.
   - Implements `push`, `pop`, and string representation for displaying the tower's state.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Base case: Move the smallest disk directly.
   - Recursive case: 
     - Move **N-1** disks from the source to the auxiliary tower.
     - Move the largest disk to the target tower.
     - Move the **N-1** disks from the auxiliary tower to the target.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - Initializes the towers and calls the recursive function.

## Implementation:

```python
class Tower:
    def __init__(self, name):
        """
        Initialize a tower with a name and an empty stack of disks.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.disks = []

    def push(self, disk):
        """
        Push a disk onto the tower.
        """
        self.disks.append(disk)

    def pop(self):
        """
        Remove and return the top disk from the tower.
        """
        return self.disks.pop()

    def __str__(self):
        """
        Return a string representation of the tower and its disks.
        """
        return f"{self.name}: {self.disks}"


def move_disks(n, source, target, aux):
    """
    Recursive function to move n disks from the source tower to the target tower.

    :param n: Number of disks to move
    :param source: The source tower
    :param target: The target tower
    :param aux: The auxiliary tower
    """
    if n == 1:
        # Base case: Move a single disk
        disk = source.pop()
        target.push(disk)
        print(f"Move disk {disk} from {source.name} to {target.name}")
        return

    # Step 1: Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary tower
    move_disks(n - 1, source, aux, target)

    # Step 2: Move the nth disk from source to target tower
    disk = source.pop()
    target.push(disk)
    print(f"Move disk {disk} from {source.name} to {target.name}")

    # Step 3: Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary tower to target tower
    move_disks(n - 1, aux, target, source)


def hanoi_towers(n):
    """
    Solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle for n disks.

    :param n: Number of disks
    """
    # Initialize the three towers
    source = Tower("Source")

        source.push(disk)

    # Print initial state of the towers
    print("Initial Towers:")
    print(source)
    print(target)
    print(aux)
    print("\nMoves:")

    # Perform the recursive disk movement
    move_disks(n, source, target, aux)

    # Print final state of the towers
    print("\nFinal Towers:")
    print(source)
    print(target)
    print(aux)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Input number of disks
    n = int(input("Enter the number of disks: "))
    hanoi_towers(n)
```

## Explanation:

### Example Walkthrough:
**Input**:
```
n = 3
```

**Initial Towers**:
```
Source: [3, 2, 1]
Target: []
Auxiliary: []
```

**Recursive Steps**:
1. Move 2 disks from Source to Auxiliary.
2. Move the largest disk (3) to Target.
3. Move 2 disks from Auxiliary to Target.


**Final Towers**:
```
Source: []
Target: [3, 2, 1]
Auxiliary: []
```

---

## Output Example:

### Input:
```
Enter the number of disks: 3
```

### Output:
```
Initial Towers:
Source: [3, 2, 1]
Target: []
Auxiliary: []

Moves:
Move disk 1 from Source to Target
Move disk 2 from Source to Auxiliary
Move disk 1 from Target to Auxiliary
Move disk 3 from Source to Target
Move disk 1 from Auxiliary to Source
Move disk 2 from Auxiliary to Target
Move disk 1 from Source to Target

Final Towers:
Source: []
Target: [3, 2, 1]
Auxiliary: []
```

### Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The function involves solving $`2^n - 1`$ moves.
   - T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1).
   - **Complexity**: O($`2^n`$).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - O(n) due to the recursion stack.

This implementation uses stacks to mimic real-world Tower of Hanoi operations effectively.
