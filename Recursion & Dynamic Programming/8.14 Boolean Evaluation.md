# 8.14 Boolean Evaluation

## Problem Description:
Given a boolean expression consisting of the symbols `0` (false), `1` (true), `&` (AND), `|` (OR), and `^` (XOR), and a
desired boolean result value **result**, implement a function to count the number of ways of parenthesizing
the expression such that it evaluates to result.

### Approach:

This problem can be solved using **recursion with memoization**. The key is to recursively split the expression at each operator and evaluate the left and right sides of the expression independently, while keeping track of the ways to get `True` or `False` on each side.

### Steps:
1. **Base Case**:
   - If the expression is a single value (`0` or `1`), it is trivially evaluated as `True` or `False`.
   
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - For each operator (`&`, `|`, `^`), split the expression into two parts â€” the left side and the right side of the operator.
   - Recursively compute the number of ways to make the left side and the right side `True` or `False`.
   - Based on the operator, calculate the number of ways to combine the left and right results to achieve the desired result.

3. **Memoization**:
   - Store the results of subproblems in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Operators**:
   - **AND (`&`)**: `True` if both sides are `True`.
   - **OR (`|`)**: `True` if at least one side is `True`.
   - **XOR (`^`)**: `True` if one side is `True` and the other is `False`.

## Code Implementation:

```python
def countEval(expr, result, memo=None):
    # Initialize memoization dictionary
    if memo is None:
        memo = {}

    # Check if the result for this expression is already computed
    key = (expr, result)
    if key in memo:
        return memo[key]

    # Base case: single value
    if len(expr) == 1:
        value = int(expr)  # convert "1" or "0" to integer
        return 1 if (value == result) else 0

    # Initialize count
    ways = 0

    # Recursively split at each operator
    for i in range(1, len(expr), 2):  # operators are at odd indices
        operator = expr[i]
        left = expr[:i]
        right = expr[i + 1:]

        # Recursively evaluate all possibilities
        left_true = countEval(left, True, memo)
        left_false = countEval(left, False, memo)
        right_true = countEval(right, True, memo)
        right_false = countEval(right, False, memo)

        # Total ways to evaluate left and right
        total_ways = (left_true + left_false) * (right_true + right_false)

        # Compute the number of ways based on operator
        if operator == '&':
            true_ways = left_true * right_true
        elif operator == '|':
            true_ways = left_true * right_true + left_true * right_false + left_false * right_true
        elif operator == '^':
            true_ways = left_true * right_false + left_false * right_true
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown operator: {operator}")

        # If the desired result is True, count the true ways; else count false ways
        if result:
            ways += true_ways
        else:
            ways += total_ways - true_ways

    # store the result in memoization dictionary
    memo[key] = ways
    return ways


# Example usage:
print(countEval("1^0|0|1", False))  # Output: 2
print(countEval("0&0&0&1^1|0", True))  # Output: 10
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: 
   - When the expression has only one symbol (`0` or `1`), we return `1` if the value matches the desired result (`True` or `False`), else return `0`.

2. **Recursive Case**: 
   - We recursively split the expression at each operator (`&`, `|`, `^`) and calculate the number of ways to evaluate the left and right sides to `True` and `False`.
   - For each operator, we calculate how the combination of results from the left and right sides can give a `True` or `False` outcome.
   
3. **Memoization**: 
   - We store the result of each subproblem (expression and desired result) in the `memo` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Operators**:
   - `&` (AND): `True` only when both sides are `True`.
   - `|` (OR): `True` when at least one side is `True`.
   - `^` (XOR): `True` when exactly one side is `True`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: 
   - In the worst case, we split the expression at each operator, and for each split, we make recursive calls for the left and right parts. With memoization, the time complexity is reduced to O($`n^2`$) where `n` is the length of the expression.
   
- **Space Complexity**: 
   - The space complexity is O($`n^2`$) due to memoization storing intermediate results for each subexpression and result.

---

### Example Outputs:

```python
print(countEval("1^0|0|1", False))  # Output: 2
print(countEval("0&0&0&1^1|0", True))  # Output: 10
```

- For the first example `1^0|0|1` with a desired result `False`, there are `2` ways to parenthesize it to get `False`.
- For the second example `0&0&0&1^1|0` with a desired result `True`, there are `10` ways to parenthesize it to get `True`.

This approach provides an efficient way to solve the problem using recursion and memoization.
