# 8.12 N-Queens Problem

## Problem Description:
Write an algorithm to print all ways of arranging eight queens on an 8x8 chess board so that none of them
share the same row, column, or diagonal. In this case, "diagonal" means all the diagonals, not just the two
that bisect the board.

### Approach:

This is a classic **backtracking** problem. Here's how to approach the solution:

1. **State**:
   - The board is represented by an array where the index represents the row and the value at that index represents the column where the queen is placed.
   
2. **Safe Check**:
   - For each new queen placement, we must check if placing it at the current row and column conflicts with any previously placed queens:
     - Check if any other queen is in the same column.
     - Check if any other queen is on the same diagonal (both primary and secondary diagonals).

3. **Backtracking**:
   - Try to place a queen in each column for the current row, and recursively place queens for subsequent rows.
   - If placing a queen leads to a conflict, backtrack and try a different column for the current row.
   
4. **Base Case**:
   - If we've successfully placed queens in all rows, we have found a valid arrangement.

5. **Return**:
   - After exploring all possibilities, return all valid solutions.

## Code Implementation:

```python
def nQueens(n):
    def isSafe(board, row, col):
        # Check all previous rows for conflicts
        for r in range(row):
            if (board[r] == col or  # Same column
                    abs(board[r] - col) == abs(r - row)):  # Same diagonal
                return False
        return True

    def place_queens(row, board, solutions):
        # If all queens are placed, add the solution
        if row == n:
            solutions.append(board[:])
            return

        for col in range(n):
            if isSafe(board, row, col):
                board[row] = col
                place_queens(row + 1, board, solutions)

    solutions = []  # List to store all solutions
    board = [-1] * n  # Initialize the board
    place_queens(0, board, solutions)  # Start the placement from row 0
    return solutions

# Example usage for an 8x8 board
n = 8
solutions = nQueens(n)
print(f"Number of solutions: {len(solutions)}")

# Print each solution
for sol in solutions:
    print(sol)
```

### Explanation:

1. **isSafe**: This function checks if placing a queen at `row` and `col` is safe:
   - It checks if any previously placed queens are in the same column (`board[r] == col`) or on the same diagonal (`abs(board[r] - col) == abs(r - row)`).

2. **place_queens**: This is the recursive function where the backtracking happens:
   - It tries to place a queen in each column of the current row. If a valid placement is found (via `isSafe`), it proceeds to the next row.
   - If the row equals `n`, it means all queens have been placed successfully, and the current board configuration is added to the `solutions` list.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - `board` is a list where each index represents a row and the value at that index represents the column where the queen is placed.
   - The recursive function starts at row 0 and continues until row `n`.

### Output:
For `n = 8`, the program will output the number of valid solutions and print each solution in the form of a list of column positions for each row.

**Example Output**:
```
Number of solutions: 92
[0, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1]
[0, 5, 7, 2, 6, 3, 1, 4]
[0, 6, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 2]
[0, 6, 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2]
...
```

Each list represents one solution where the index is the row and the value is the column of the queen in that row.

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the backtracking solution is **O(n!)**. This is because in the worst case, for each row, we try placing the queen in all `n` columns, and for each valid placement, we recursively place queens for the next row.
   
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the space required to store the `board` array and the recursion stack.

This approach efficiently finds all solutions to the N-Queens problem, and the backtracking ensures that we only explore valid configurations.
