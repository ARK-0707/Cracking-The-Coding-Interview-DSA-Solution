# 8.13 Stack of Boxes

## Problem Description:
You have a stack of `n` boxes, with widths $`w_i`$, height $`h_i`$, and depth $`d_i`$. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only
be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width,
height, and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack. The height of the
stack is the sum of the heights of each box.

### Approach:

This is a **dynamic programming** problem where we need to find the maximum stack height, similar to the `Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)` problem, but with three dimensions (width, height, and depth).

### Steps:

1. **Sorting Boxes**:
   - To make sure the boxes are ordered for easier stacking, we sort the boxes by their width (or depth, or height). In this case, we'll use the width.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - We use a dynamic programming array `dp[]` where `dp[i]` will store the maximum height of the stack with box `i` at the top.
   
3. **State Transition**:
   - For each box `i`, check all the previous boxes `j` (where `j < i`) and see if box `i` can be placed on box `j`. This is checked using the function `can_stack_on(top, bottom)`.
   - If `top` can be placed on `bottom`, then update the height at `dp[i]`.

4. **Result**:
   - The maximum value in `dp[]` will give the height of the tallest possible stack.

## Code Implementation:

```python
class Box:
    def __init__(self, width, height, depth):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.depth = depth

def can_stack_on(top, bottom):
    # Return True if top can be placed on bottom
    return (top.width < bottom.width and
            top.height < bottom.height and
            top.depth < bottom.depth)

def max_stack_height(boxes):
    # Sort boxes by width
    boxes.sort(key=lambda box: box.width, reverse=True)

    n = len(boxes)
    dp = [0] * n  # dp[i] will store max stack height with boxes[i] on top

    # Initialize dp[i] with the height of each box
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = boxes[i].height

    # Compute dp values
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(0, i):
            if can_stack_on(boxes[i], boxes[j]):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + boxes[i].height)

    return max(dp)

# Example usage
boxes = [
    Box(4, 6, 7),
    Box(1, 2, 3),
    Box(4, 5, 6),
    Box(10, 12, 32)
]

print("Max stack height: ", max_stack_height(boxes))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Class `Box`**:
   - The `Box` class represents each box with `width`, `height`, and `depth` attributes.

2. **Helper Function `can_stack_on(top, bottom)`**:
   - This function checks if a box `top` can be placed on top of `bottom`. For the box to be placed, it must have a smaller width, height, and depth than the `bottom` box.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We first sort the boxes in decreasing order of width.
   - We then initialize a `dp` array where each element is initialized to the height of the corresponding box.
   - We iterate over all pairs of boxes, and for each pair, we check if one box can be placed on the other. If it can, we update the maximum stack height by including the current box's height.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The tallest stack is found by returning the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum stack height achievable with any box at the top.

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Sorting the boxes takes **O(n log n)**.
   - The nested loops (for each pair of boxes) take **O($`n^2`$)** in the worst case.
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O($`n^2`$)**.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the `dp[]` array storing the stack heights for each box.

---

### Example Output:

```
Max stack height:  60
```

In this example:
- We have four boxes with the given dimensions.
- The tallest stack is formed by stacking boxes in the following order: Box(10, 12, 32), Box(4, 6, 7), Box(4, 5, 6), and Box(1, 2, 3).
- The maximum stack height is the sum of the heights of the stacked boxes: `32 + 7 + 6 + 2 = 60`.

This approach efficiently computes the tallest stack possible while adhering to the constraints.
