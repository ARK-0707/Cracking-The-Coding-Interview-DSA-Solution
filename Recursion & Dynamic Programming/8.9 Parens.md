# 8.9 Parens

## Problem Description:
Implement an algorithm to print all valid (e.g., properly opened and closed) combinations of n pairs of parentheses.

### Example:

**Input**:  
```
n = 3
```

**Output**:
```
((())), (()()), (())(), ()(()), ()()()
```

## Approach:

### Using Backtracking:
1. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - The key idea is to **build** valid parentheses combinations by adding opening `(` and closing `)` parentheses one by one and maintaining valid counts.
   - For a combination to be valid:
     - We can add an opening parenthesis `(` if the number of opening parentheses used so far is less than `n`.
     - We can add a closing parenthesis `)` if the number of closing parentheses used so far is less than the number of opening parentheses.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - Once the string `s` has a length of `2 * n` (since each valid combination contains `n` opening and `n` closing parentheses), add it to the result list.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - A helper function `backtrack` is defined to explore all possible combinations of parentheses recursively.

4. **Tracking Open and Close Parentheses**:
   - Maintain two counters: `open_count` for the number of opening parentheses and `close_count` for the number of closing parentheses used so far.

## Implementation:

```python
def generate_parentheses(n):
    """
    Generate all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.

    :param n: The number of pairs of parentheses
    :return: A list of valid combinations
    """
    def backtrack(s, open_count, close_count):
        """
        Recursive helper function to generate parentheses combinations.

        :param s: The current string being built
        :param open_count: The count of opening parentheses used
        :param close_count: The count of closing parentheses used
        """
        if len(s) == 2 * n:
            result.append(s)  # When the string is of length 2*n, add it to the result
            return
        if open_count < n:
            # Add an opening parenthesis if we haven't added n opening ones yet
            backtrack(s + '(', open_count + 1, close_count)
        if close_count < open_count:
            # Add a closing parenthesis if it doesn't exceed the number of opening ones
            backtrack(s + ')', open_count, close_count + 1)

    result = []  # List to store all valid combinations
    backtrack('', 0, 0)  # Initial recursive call with an empty string and both counts as 0
    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 3
    result = generate_parentheses(n)
    print("All valid combinations of parentheses are: ")
    for combination in result:
        print(combination, end=", ")
```

## Explanation:

### Example Walkthrough:
**Input**:
```
n = 3
```

1. We start with an empty string and both the `open_count` and `close_count` as 0.
2. The `backtrack` function will first try to add an opening parenthesis `(`, increasing the `open_count`.
3. It will then recursively add more opening parentheses as long as `open_count` is less than `n`.
4. Once the `open_count` reaches `n`, the function will start adding closing parentheses `)` as long as the `close_count` is less than `open_count`.
5. When the length of the string reaches `2 * n`, a valid combination has been formed and is added to the result list.



**Output**:
```
((())), (()()), (())(), ()(()), ()()()
```

---

### Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The algorithm generates all possible valid combinations, and the number of valid combinations for `n` pairs of parentheses is given by the **n-th Catalan number**, which is O($`4^n / âˆšn`$). This is because the number of valid combinations grows exponentially with `n`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive stack and the space used for storing the result list.

---

## Key Insights:
- **Backtracking** is an effective technique for generating combinations or permutations where some constraints (like parentheses validity) must be respected.
- **Tracking counts** of opening and closing parentheses ensures that each combination remains valid and meets the required number of pairs.
