# 8.4 Power Set

## Problem Description
Write a method to return all subsets of set.

---

## Approach
To generate all subsets of a set, we use the **binary representation** of integers from `0` to $`2^n - 1`$, where `n` is the size of the set:
1. Each integer represents a possible subset.
2. The binary representation of the integer determines which elements of the set are included in the subset.
   - If the `i-th` bit of the binary number is `1`, include the `i-th` element of the set in the subset.
   - If the `i-th` bit is `0`, exclude the `i-th` element.

### Key Observations:
- For a set of size `n`, there are $`2^n`$ subsets.
- This approach uses bitwise operations for efficiency.

---

## Code Implementation

```python
def get_subsets(set_list):
    """
    Generate all subsets of a given set using bitwise operations.

    :param set_list: List of elements representing the set.
    :return: A list of subsets, where each subset is represented as a list.
    """
    n = len(set_list)
    all_subsets = []

    # Iterate from 0 to 2^n - 1 (2^n subsets in total)
    for subset_mask in range(1 << n):  # `1 << n` equals `2^n`
        subset = []
        for i in range(n):
            # Check if the i-th bit is set in subset_mask
            if subset_mask & (1 << i):
                subset.append(set_list[i])
        all_subsets.append(subset)

    return all_subsets


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Input set
    input_set = [10, 15, 20]

    # Generate all subsets
    result = get_subsets(input_set)

    # Print all subsets
    print("All subsets are:")
    for subset in result:
        print(subset)
```

## Explanation

### Steps to Generate Subsets:
1. **Iterate Over All Possible Masks**:
   - A **mask** is a binary number where each bit corresponds to whether an element is included in the subset.
   - For a set of size `n`, masks range from `0` (empty subset) to $`2^n - 1`$ (full set).

2. **Determine Elements in Each Subset**:
   - For each mask, iterate over all indices.
   - If the `i-th` bit in the mask is `1`, include the `i-th` element of the set in the subset.

3. **Collect All Subsets**:
   - Append each generated subset to the list of all subsets.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates $`2^n`$ times, where `n` is the size of the set.
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates `n` times for each subset.
- **Total**: O($`n * 2^n`$), which is optimal for generating all subsets.

#### Space Complexity:
- **Space for Subsets**: Each subset is stored in the output list, leading to O($`2^n`$) space.
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(`n`) for storing a single subset temporarily.

## Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```
Set = [10, 15, 20]
```

### Steps:
1. **Binary Masks**:
   - For `n = 3`, masks range from `000` to `111` (binary), i.e., `0` to `7` (decimal).

2. **Subsets**:
   - Mask `000` (decimal `0`): Empty subset `[]`.
   - Mask `001` (decimal `1`): Include only the first element `[10]`.
   - Mask `010` (decimal `2`): Include only the second element `[15]`.
   - Mask `011` (decimal `3`): Include the first and second elements `[10, 15]`.
   - Mask `100` (decimal `4`): Include only the third element `[20]`.
   - Mask `101` (decimal `5`): Include the first and third elements `[10, 20]`.
   - Mask `110` (decimal `6`): Include the second and third elements `[15, 20]`.
   - Mask `111` (decimal `7`): Include all elements `[10, 15, 20]`.

### Output:
```
All subsets are:
[]
[10]
[15]
[10, 15]
[20]
[10, 20]
[15, 20]
[10, 15, 20]
```

## Limitations and Optimizations

### Limitation:
- The time complexity of O($`n * 2^n`$) makes this approach impractical for very large sets (e.g., `n > 20`) due to exponential growth.

### Optimization:
- For very large sets, consider generating subsets lazily (on-demand) using generators to save memory.

### Generator-Based Approach:
```python
def get_subsets_generator(set_list):
    n = len(set_list)
    for subset_mask in range(1 << n):
        yield [set_list[i] for i in range(n) if subset_mask & (1 << i)]

# Example usage
for subset in get_subsets_generator([10, 15, 20]):
    print(subset)
```

This approach avoids storing all subsets in memory at once.
