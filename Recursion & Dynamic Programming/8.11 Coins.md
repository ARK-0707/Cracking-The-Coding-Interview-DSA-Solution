# 8.11 Coins

## Problem Description:
Given an infinite number of `quarters` (25 cents), `dimes` (10 cents), `nickels` (5 cents), and `pennies` (1 cent),
write the code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents.

### Example:

**Input**:
```
Coins: [25, 10, 5, 1]
n = 10
```

**Output**:
```
4
```

There are 4 ways to make 10 cents:
1. 10 pennies
2. 1 dime
3. 1 nickel + 5 pennies
4. 2 nickels

## Approach:

### Dynamic Programming Solution:
This is a classic **coin change** problem that can be solved using dynamic programming (DP).

1. **State**: 
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to make `i` cents using the available coins.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is exactly one way to make 0 cents, which is to not use any coins.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each coin in the list of coins, update the `dp` array. For each amount from the value of the coin up to `n`, update `dp[amount]` by adding `dp[amount - coin]`. This accounts for the ways we can make that amount by including the current coin.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - After processing all the coins, `dp[n]` will contain the number of ways to represent `n` cents.

## Implementation:

```python
def CoinChange(coins, n):
    """
    Calculate the number of ways to represent n cents using an infinite supply of given coins.

    :param coins: List of coin denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
    :param n: The target amount in cents
    :return: The number of ways to represent n cents using the coins
    """
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # Array to store the number of ways to make each amount from 0 to n
    dp[0] = 1  # There is one way to make 0 cents (use no coins)

    # Loop through each coin denomination
    for coin in coins:
        # Update the number of ways for each amount from coin to n
        for amount in range(coin, n + 1):
            dp[amount] += dp[amount - coin]

    return dp[n]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    coins = [25, 10, 5, 1]  # Denominations of coins
    n = 10  # Target amount in cents

    # Calculate and print the number of ways to represent n cents
    result = CoinChange(coins, n)
    print(f"Number of ways to make {n} cents: {result}")
```

## Explanation:

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input**:
```
Coins: [25, 10, 5, 1]
n = 10
```

1. The `dp` array starts as `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (length `n+1`), where `dp[0] = 1` because there is one way to make 0 cents: using no coins.
2. Iterate through each coin (25, 10, 5, 1) and update the `dp` array:
   - For the coin `1`, we update the `dp` values for all amounts from 1 to 10.
   - For the coin `5`, we update the `dp` values for all amounts from 5 to 10.
   - For the coin `10`, we update the `dp` values for amounts 10.
3. At the end of the loop, `dp[10]` will give the number of ways to make 10 cents, which is 4.

### Output:
```
Number of ways to make 10 cents: 4
```

## Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is O(n * m), where `n` is the target amount and `m` is the number of different coin denominations. This is because we iterate over all coins for each amount up to `n`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(n) because we only need an array of size `n + 1` to store the number of ways for each amount from 0 to `n`.

---

### Key Insights:
- The **dynamic programming** approach efficiently solves the coin change problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
- **Reuse** of previously computed results (stored in the `dp` array) ensures that we donâ€™t recompute the number of ways for each amount, leading to an optimized solution.
