# 8.10 Paint Fill Algorithm

## Problem Description:
Implement the **"paint fill"** function that one might see on many image editing programs. That is, given a `screen`
(represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point, and a new color, fill in the surrounding area
until the color changes from the original color.

### Example:

**Input**:
```
Screen: 
[
    [1, 1, 1, 2],
    [1, 1, 2, 2],
    [1, 2, 2, 2],
    [3, 3, 3, 3]
]
Row: 0, Col: 3
New Color: 9
```

**Output**:
```
[
    [1, 1, 1, 9],
    [1, 1, 9, 9],
    [1, 9, 9, 9],
    [3, 3, 3, 3]
]
```

## Approach:

### Using Depth-First Search (DFS):
1. **Base Case**:
   - If the color at the starting position is already the same as the new color, return the screen immediately since there's no need to fill.
   
2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Starting from the given position `(row, col)`, recursively visit all connected cells that have the original color and change their color to the new color.
   - Check the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right) for further recursive filling.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Make sure that the recursive filling stays within the bounds of the screen.
   - If the color of a neighboring cell is different from the original color, stop filling in that direction.

4. **Color Change**:
   - Change the color of the current cell to the new color only if the original color matches.

## Implementation:

```python
def paint_fill(screen, row, col, new_color):
    """
    Perform a paint fill operation starting from the given point and fill all
    connected cells with the same color as the start with the new color.

    :param screen: The 2D array representing the screen with colors
    :param row: The row index of the starting point
    :param col: The column index of the starting point
    :param new_color: The new color to fill with
    :return: The updated screen after the paint fill operation
    """
    rows = len(screen)
    cols = len(screen[0])
    original_color = screen[row][col]

    # Base Case: If the original color is the same as the new color
    if original_color == new_color:
        return screen

    # Recursive Helper Function
    def fill(r, c):
        # Check if the position is out of bounds
        if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols:
            return
        # Check if the current color is the original color
        if screen[r][c] != original_color:
            return
        # Change the color to the new color
        screen[r][c] = new_color
        # Recur for the neighboring cells
        fill(r - 1, c)  # Up
        fill(r + 1, c)  # Down
        fill(r, c - 1)  # Left
        fill(r, c + 1)  # Right

    # Start the recursive filling process
    fill(row, col)
    return screen


if __name__ == "__main__":
    screen = [
        [1, 1, 1, 2],
        [1, 1, 2, 2],
        [1, 2, 2, 2],
        [3, 3, 3, 3]
    ]

    row, col = 0, 3  # Starting point (row 0, col 3)
    new_color = 9     # New color to fill with

    result = paint_fill(screen, row, col, new_color)

    for row in result:
        print(row, end="\n")
```

## Explanation:

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input**:
```
Screen:
[
    [1, 1, 1, 2],
    [1, 1, 2, 2],
    [1, 2, 2, 2],
    [3, 3, 3, 3]
]
Row: 0, Col: 3
New Color: 9
```

1. The starting point is `(0, 3)` which has the color `2`. The original color is `2`, and the new color is `9`.
2. The function will check each adjacent cell:
   - `(0, 2)` has the same original color `2`, so it will be filled with the new color.
   - This process will continue for all connected cells with the color `2`.
3. The final screen after filling all connected cells with color `9`:

```
[
    [1, 1, 1, 9],
    [1, 1, 9, 9],
    [1, 9, 9, 9],
    [3, 3, 3, 3]
]
```

## Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The worst-case scenario occurs when all cells have the same color as the original color and the entire grid needs to be filled. The time complexity is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the screen.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is O(m * n) due to the recursive call stack, as in the worst case, the function might recurse through every cell in the grid.

### Key Insights:
- The **paint fill** function utilizes a **depth-first search (DFS)** approach to explore connected regions of the same color.
- **Recursion** is used to visit each cell and fill it until the entire connected region is updated with the new color.
- Boundary conditions and checking the color of neighboring cells are critical for ensuring that the algorithm fills only the correct region and stops at the appropriate boundaries.
