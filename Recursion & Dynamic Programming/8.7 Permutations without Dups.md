# 8.7 Permutations without Dups

## Problem Description:
Write a method to compute all permutations of a string of unique characters.

---

## Approach:

### Recursive Solution:
1. **Base Case**:
   - If the string is empty, return a list containing just the empty string.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - For each character, treat it as the first character of a permutation.
   - Compute permutations for the remaining substring recursively.
   - Prepend the current character to each permutation of the remaining substring.

3. **Iterative Construction**:
   - Use a loop to systematically explore all characters as potential starting points.
   - For each recursive call, generate permutations of the smaller substring, ultimately building up the complete set.

## Implementation:

```python
# Function to compute all permutations of a string of unique characters
def permutations(s):
    """
    Generate all permutations of a string with unique characters.

    :param s: The input string
    :return: A list of all permutations
    """
    if len(s) == 0:
        return ['']  # Base case: Empty string has one permutation (itself)

    # List to store all permutations
    result = []

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Generate the remaining string by excluding the current character
        remaining = s[:i] + s[i+1:]

        # Recursively compute permutations of the remaining string
        for perm in permutations(remaining):
            # Prepend the current character to each permutation of the remaining string
            result.append(char + perm)

    return result


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Input string from the user
    input_str = input("Enter a string to compute its permutations: ")

    # Compute all permutations of the input string
    result = permutations(input_str)

    # Print all permutations
    print("All permutations are:")
    for perm in result:
        print(perm)
```

## Explanation:

### Example Walkthrough:
**Input**:
```
abc
```

**Recursive Breakdown**:
1. Start with `s = "abc"`. For the first character `'a'`:
   - Remaining string: `"bc"`
   - Permutations of `"bc"`:
     - `'b'` + permutations of `"c"` → `"bc"`
     - `'c'` + permutations of `"b"` → `"cb"`
   - Prepend `'a'` → `["abc", "acb"]`

2. For `'b'` as the first character:
   - Remaining string: `"ac"`
   - Permutations of `"ac"`:
     - `'a'` + permutations of `"c"` → `"ac"`
     - `'c'` + permutations of `"a"` → `"ca"`
   - Prepend `'b'` → `["bac", "bca"]`

3. For `'c'` as the first character:
   - Remaining string: `"ab"`
   - Permutations of `"ab"`:
     - `'a'` + permutations of `"b"` → `"ab"`
     - `'b'` + permutations of `"a"` → `"ba"`
   - Prepend `'c'` → `["cab", "cba"]`

**Result**:
All permutations: `["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]`

---

## Output Example:

### Input:
```
Enter a string to compute its permutations: abc
```

### Output:
```
All permutations are:
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
```

---

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - For a string of length `n`, there are `n!` permutations.
   - Each recursive call splits the string into smaller substrings.
   - **Overall Complexity**: O($`n * n!`$).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Recursive calls consume space proportional to the depth of recursion, which is O(n).
   - **Overall Complexity**: O(n) for recursion stack and O($`n!`$) for result storage.

---

## Key Insights:
- This algorithm leverages **divide and conquer** to recursively break the problem into smaller sub-problems.
- The order of operations ensures all permutations are systematically constructed and no duplicates occur.
- The recursive nature makes the implementation compact and intuitive while effectively generating results.
