# 8.5 Recursive Multiply

## Problem Description
Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using `'*'` operator. You can use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations.

---

## Approach

### Recursive Multiplication Using Bit Manipulation
The multiplication of two integers `a` and `b` can be broken down recursively:
1. **Base Case**:
   - If `b == 0`, the result is `0` (anything multiplied by 0 is 0).
   - If `b == 1`, the result is `a` (anything multiplied by 1 is itself).

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - If `b` is even:
     - Multiply `a` with `b` using the formula:
       
       $`a * b = (a * 2) * (b / 2)`$
       
       Here, `a << 1` represents `a * 2`, and `b >> 1` represents `b / 2`.
   - If `b` is odd:
     - Break the multiplication into:

       $`a * b = a + (a * (b - 1))`$

This reduces the problem size significantly by halving `b` at each step for even numbers, leading to a logarithmic reduction in the number of recursive calls.

## Code Implementation

```python
def multiplyRecursive(a, b):
    """
    Multiply two positive integers recursively without using '*'.
    Uses addition, subtraction, and bitwise operators for optimization.
    
    :param a: First positive integer
    :param b: Second positive integer
    :return: The product of a and b
    """
    # Ensure a is the larger number for optimization
    a, b = max(a, b), min(a, b)

    # Base cases
    if b == 0:
        return 0  # Multiplication with 0
    if b == 1:
        return a  # Multiplication with 1

    # Recursive case
    if b % 2 == 0:  # If b is even
        return multiplyRecursive(a << 1, b >> 1)  # Halve b and double a
    else:  # If b is odd
        return a + multiplyRecursive(a, b - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Input two positive integers
    a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

    # Perform recursive multiplication
    result = multiplyRecursive(a, b)

    # Output the result
    print(f"{a} X {b} = {result}")
```

## Explanation

### Steps for Multiplication:
1. **Recursive Decomposition**:
   - Break down the multiplication into smaller steps by halving `b` (if even) or reducing it by 1 (if odd).
2. **Optimization via Bit Shifting**:
   - Use `a << 1` to double `a` (efficiently equivalent to `a * 2`).
   - Use `b >> 1` to halve `b` (efficiently equivalent to `b // 2`).

---

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
- The number of recursive calls depends on the size of `b`.
- If `b` is even, the size of the problem reduces by half each time:
  - Total calls â‰ˆ O(log(b)).

#### Space Complexity:
- O(log(b)) due to the recursion stack.

---

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input:
```
a = 5, b = 3
```

#### Execution:
1. **First Call**: `multiplyRecursive(5, 3)`
   - `b` is odd, so:
     
     $`5 * 3 = 5 + multiplyRecursive(5, 2)`$
     

2. **Second Call**: `multiplyRecursive(5, 2)`
   - `b` is even, so:

     $`5 * 2 = multiplyRecursive(10, 1)`$

3. **Third Call**: `multiplyRecursive(10, 1)`
   - Base case: `b == 1`, return `10`.

4. **Backtrack**:
   - Second Call: `5 * 2 = 10`.
   - First Call: `5 * 3 = 5 + 10 = 15`.

#### Output:
```
5 * 3 = 15
```

## Edge Cases
1. **`a = 0`, `b = 0`**:
   - Output: `0`, as `0 * 0 = 0`.
2. **`a = 1`, `b = 1`**:
   - Output: `1`, as `1 * 1 = 1`.
3. **Large Inputs**:
   - The recursive approach is efficient for large inputs due to logarithmic depth.

---

## Example Output

### Input:
```
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 8
```

### Output:
```
12 * 8 = 96
```

This approach minimizes operations and leverages bitwise shifts for efficient computation.
