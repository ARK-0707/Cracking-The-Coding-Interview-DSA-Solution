# 9.1 Stock Data

## Problem Description
Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called by up to 1000 client application to get simple
end-of-day stock price information (open, close, high, low). You may assume that you already have the data, and
you can store it in any format you wish. How would you design the client-facing service that provides the
information to client applications? You are responsible for the development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring
and maintenance of the feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would recommend your
approach. Your service can use any technologies you wish, and can distribute the information to the client
application in any mechanism you choose.

## Solution

Designing a client-facing service to deliver end-of-day stock price information to up to 1,000 clients involves several considerations, including scalability, reliability, low latency, and ease of maintenance. Hereâ€™s how I would design such a system:

---

### **System Overview**
1. **Client Requirements**: Up to 1,000 concurrent clients requesting end-of-day stock data (Open, Close, High, Low).
2. **Data Characteristics**: Read-heavy workload with limited writes (end-of-day updates).
3. **Non-functional Requirements**:
   - High availability and fault tolerance.
   - Scalability to accommodate more clients in the future.
   - Monitoring and alerting for system health.

---

### **Key Components**

#### **1. Data Storage**
- **Options Considered**:
  - **Relational Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)**: Good for structured queries and relationships but might face scalability challenges with concurrent reads.
  - **NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB)**: Optimized for high read/write throughput and flexibility.
  - **In-Memory Databases (e.g., Redis, Memcached)**: Excellent for caching frequently accessed data.

- **Recommendation**: Use a combination of a primary database (NoSQL) for persistent storage and an in-memory database (Redis) for caching.
  - **Why?** NoSQL databases scale horizontally for large datasets, while Redis reduces latency for frequently accessed stock data.

---

#### **2. API Design**
- **Options Considered**:
  - **REST API**: Simple and widely supported.
  - **GraphQL**: Flexible for client-specific queries.
  - **gRPC**: Highly efficient for binary communication.

- **Recommendation**: Use a **REST API**.
  - **Why?** REST is simple to implement, well-supported, and sufficient for the relatively straightforward stock data payload.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /stocks`: Fetch all end-of-day stock data.
  - `GET /stocks/{symbol}`: Fetch specific stock's data.

- **Response Format**: JSON (standard and easy for clients to parse).

---

#### **3. Scalability and Load Distribution**
- **Options Considered**:
  - **Single Server**: Simplest but not scalable.
  - **Horizontal Scaling with Load Balancer**: Distribute requests across multiple instances.
  - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Cache responses geographically closer to clients.

- **Recommendation**:
  - Use a **Load Balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Nginx)** to distribute traffic.
  - Deploy the service on a **Kubernetes Cluster** or **Auto-scaling Cloud Instances** to handle scaling dynamically.

---

#### **4. Data Update Mechanism**
- **Options Considered**:
  - **Polling**: Clients repeatedly request updates.
  - **Push Notifications**: Server pushes updates to clients (e.g., WebSockets).
  - **Scheduled Updates**: Provide updates once per day.

- **Recommendation**: Use a **scheduled update mechanism** with pre-computed end-of-day data.
  - **Why?** Efficient for use cases where data is updated only once per day.

---

#### **5. Monitoring and Maintenance**
- **Tools**:
  - **Logging**: Use tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or AWS CloudWatch for logging.
  - **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
  - **Alerting**: Configure alerts for key metrics (e.g., API latency, error rate).

- **Automated Health Checks**: Use health check endpoints (`/health`) and integrate with the load balancer to detect unhealthy instances.

---

### **System Architecture**

1. **Clients**: Applications making requests for stock data.
2. **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all API requests.
3. **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests to multiple service instances.
4. **Application Layer**: Handles business logic for fetching and serving stock data.
5. **Cache Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed stock data.
6. **Database Layer**: NoSQL database for persistent storage of stock data.
7. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for system health and performance.
8. **Deployment**: Use Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes.

---

### **Workflow**

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - At the end of each trading day, batch process and store stock data in the NoSQL database.
   - Precompute and cache frequently requested data in Redis.

2. **Client Request Handling**:
   - Client sends a request to the API Gateway.
   - API Gateway forwards the request to the appropriate service instance via the Load Balancer.
   - Service retrieves data from Redis (or database if not cached) and returns the response.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Continuously monitor API response times, error rates, and system load.
   - Automatically scale up/down instances based on traffic.

---

### **Technologies**
- **Frontend**: Simple client for testing the API (React.js, or Postman for manual tests).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or FastAPI for REST API.
- **Database**: MongoDB for persistent storage, Redis for caching.
- **Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP with Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.

---

### **Advantages of This Approach**
1. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling ensures support for future growth.
2. **Performance**: Redis reduces latency for high-throughput reads.
3. **Simplicity**: REST API is easy for clients to integrate.
4. **Cost-Efficiency**: Scheduled updates and caching minimize redundant database calls.
