# 9.2 Social Network

## Problem Description
How would you design the data structures for a very large social network like Facebook or LinkedIn? Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the shortest path between two people (e.g. Me → Bob → Susan → Jason → You).

## Solution

Designing data structures and algorithms for a large-scale social network involves balancing efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. Here's how we can approach this problem:

---

### **Part 1: Data Structure Design**

The social network can be represented as a **graph**:
- **Nodes (Vertices)**: Represent users (e.g., Me, Bob, Susan, etc.).
- **Edges**: Represent connections (friendship or professional relationships) between users.

#### **Graph Representation**
1. **Adjacency List**:
   - Each user is a key in a dictionary (hashmap), and the value is a list of their connections (friends).
   - Example:
     ```python
     graph = {
         "Me": ["Bob", "Alice"],
         "Bob": ["Me", "Susan"],
         "Alice": ["Me", "Jason"],
         "Susan": ["Bob", "Jason"],
         "Jason": ["Alice", "Susan", "You"],
         "You": ["Jason"]
     }
     ```
   - **Why Adjacency List?** Efficient for storing sparse graphs (social networks are typically sparse).

2. **Additional Metadata**:
   - Each node can store additional metadata (e.g., name, age, location).
   - Store this in a separate dictionary if needed:
     ```python
     metadata = {
         "Me": {"name": "John", "age": 25},
         "Bob": {"name": "Bob", "age": 30},
         ...
     }
     ```

#### **Graph Storage Options**
- **In-Memory (for small networks)**: Use Python dictionaries or other similar structures.
- **Database (for large networks)**:
  - **Graph Databases** (e.g., Neo4j): Designed for graph data and efficient traversal.
  - **Relational Databases**: Use a "users" table and a "connections" table for relationships.

### **Part 2: Algorithm to Find the Shortest Path**

We need to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph (connections have equal weight). This can be achieved using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

#### **Why BFS?**
- BFS finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- It explores neighbors level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found first.

#### **Algorithm: BFS for Shortest Path**
```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    # Edge case: if start or end not in graph
    if start not in graph or end not in graph:
        return None

    # Queue for BFS: stores (current node, path so far)
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    visited = set()  # To avoid re-visiting nodes

    while queue:
        current, path = queue.popleft()

        # If we reached the target node, return the path
        if current == end:
            return path

        # Mark the current node as visited
        visited.add(current)

        # Add unvisited neighbors to the queue
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    # If no path is found
    return None
```

#### **Example Execution**
Input:
```python
graph = {
    "Me": ["Bob", "Alice"],
    "Bob": ["Me", "Susan"],
    "Alice": ["Me", "Jason"],
    "Susan": ["Bob", "Jason"],
    "Jason": ["Alice", "Susan", "You"],
    "You": ["Jason"]
}

shortest_path(graph, "Me", "You")
```

Output:
```python
['Me', 'Alice', 'Jason', 'You']
```

### **Part 3: Scalability for Large Social Networks**

1. **Challenges**:
   - **Memory Usage**: Storing billions of users and connections.
   - **Latency**: Fast pathfinding despite network size.
   - **Dynamic Updates**: Adding/removing nodes and edges.

2. **Optimizations**:
   - **Distributed Graph Storage**: Use graph databases like Neo4j or distributed systems like Apache Cassandra to shard data across multiple nodes.
   - **Indexing**: Precompute and index common paths (e.g., 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-degree connections).
   - **Heuristic Search**:
     - Use **Bidirectional BFS** to search from both start and end nodes, meeting in the middle. This reduces search space.
     - Use **A\*** (A-star) search with a heuristic function for prioritized traversal in cases where additional metadata is available (e.g., geographic proximity).

#### **Bidirectional BFS Example**
```python
def bidirectional_bfs(graph, start, end):
    if start not in graph or end not in graph:
        return None

    # Two sets for the BFS from both directions
    start_queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    end_queue = deque([(end, [end])])
    visited_from_start = {start: [start]}
    visited_from_end = {end: [end]}

    while start_queue and end_queue:
        # Expand from the start side
        current, path = start_queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited_from_start:
                new_path = path + [neighbor]
                visited_from_start[neighbor] = new_path
                start_queue.append((neighbor, new_path))

                # Check if paths meet
                if neighbor in visited_from_end:
                    return new_path + visited_from_end[neighbor][::-1][1:]

        # Expand from the end side
        current, path = end_queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited_from_end:
                new_path = path + [neighbor]
                visited_from_end[neighbor] = new_path
                end_queue.append((neighbor, new_path))

                # Check if paths meet
                if neighbor in visited_from_start:
                    return visited_from_start[neighbor] + new_path[::-1][1:]

    return None
```

### **Advantages of This Design**
1. **Efficiency**: BFS ensures the shortest path is found with minimal computation.
2. **Scalability**: Adjacency lists and distributed storage scale well with large networks.
3. **Extensibility**: Algorithms like Bidirectional BFS and A\* adapt well to specific use cases.
