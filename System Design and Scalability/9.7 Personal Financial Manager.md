# 9.7 Personal Financial Manager

## Problem Description
Explain how you would design a personal financial manager (like Mint.com). This system would connect to your bank accounts,
analyze your spending habits, and make recommendations.

## Solution
Designing a personal financial manager (PFM) like **Mint.com** involves integrating financial data from multiple sources, analyzing user transactions, and providing actionable insights. Here's how the system can be architected:

---

### **1. System Requirements**
#### **Functional Requirements**
1. **Account Aggregation**:
   - Connect securely to multiple financial institutions (banks, credit cards, investments).
   - Import account balances and transaction history.
2. **Spending Categorization**:
   - Classify transactions into categories (e.g., groceries, dining, travel).
3. **Analytics and Insights**:
   - Visualize spending habits with graphs and charts.
   - Generate monthly budgets and savings goals.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Suggest ways to save money or optimize spending.
   - Identify recurring subscriptions or unnecessary charges.
5. **Security**:
   - Ensure secure handling of sensitive financial data.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Scalability**: Handle millions of users and transactions.
2. **Reliability**: Ensure data accuracy and system availability.
3. **Low Latency**: Provide real-time or near-real-time updates.
4. **Compliance**: Follow regulations like PCI DSS, GDPR, and CCPA.

   - Tools: React (web), React Native/Flutter (mobile).
2. **Backend Services**:
   - APIs to fetch and process financial data.
   - Tools: Node.js, Python, or Java.
3. **Data Storage**:
   - Relational DB for structured data (e.g., PostgreSQL).
   - NoSQL DB for unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB).
4. **Data Processing**:
   - For categorization and analytics.
   - Tools: Apache Spark or Python-based pipelines.
5. **External Integrations**:
   - Bank APIs for account aggregation.

### **3. Workflow**

#### **A. Account Aggregation**
1. **User Authentication**:
   - The user logs in and links their financial accounts.
   - Use OAuth2 for secure, delegated access to bank APIs.
2. **Data Fetching**:
   - Pull transaction data, balances, and account details using third-party aggregators (e.g., Plaid).
3. **Data Storage**:
   - Store normalized transaction data in a database for further processing.

---

#### **B. Spending Categorization**
1. **Transaction Parsing**:
   - Extract metadata from transactions (e.g., merchant name, amount, date).
2. **Categorization Engine**:
   - Classify transactions using:
     - Rule-based methods (e.g., "Starbucks" -> "Dining").
     - Machine learning (e.g., NLP models for merchant names).
   - Update the classification model continuously as more data is collected.

---

#### **C. Analytics and Insights**
1. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Calculate total spending, income, and savings for selected periods.
   - Group spending by categories and visualize trends.
2. **Insights Generation**:
   - Identify anomalies, e.g., a spike in spending.
   - Highlight recurring transactions, such as subscriptions.
   - Suggest budget adjustments based on patterns.

---

#### **D. Recommendations**
1. **Budgeting**:
   - Recommend monthly budgets based on historical spending.
   - Notify users when they exceed budget limits.
2. **Savings Goals**:
   - Suggest saving a fixed amount toward user-defined goals.
3. **Optimization**:
   - Recommend switching to cheaper subscriptions or credit cards with better benefits.
4. **Alert System**:
   - Notify users of unusual charges or low balances.

---

#### **E. Data Visualization**
- Use tools like **D3.js** or **Chart.js** to render:
  - Spending trends (line charts).
  - Category breakdowns (pie/bar charts).
  - Budget progress (gauges).

---

### **4. Detailed Architecture**

#### **A. Frontend**
- **Mobile/Web App**:
  - Allows users to view financial insights and manage linked accounts.
  - REST/GraphQL APIs for backend communication.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Frontend: React.js, React Native, or Flutter.
  - State Management: Redux or Context API.

---

#### **B. Backend**
1. **API Gateway**:
   - Exposes APIs for the frontend and integrates with third-party services like Plaid.
   - Handles authentication and request validation.
2. **Core Services**:
   - **Data Aggregation Service**:
     - Integrates with bank APIs to pull user data.
   - **Categorization Service**:
     - Uses rules and ML models to classify transactions.
   - **Insights Service**:
     - Generates analytics and recommendations.
   - **Notification Service**:
     - Sends alerts via email or push notifications.

---

#### **C. Data Layer**
1. **Storage**:
   - **Relational DB**:
     - Users, accounts, transactions.
   - **NoSQL DB**:
     - Categorization rules, precomputed analytics.
2. **Caching**:
   - Use **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., recent transactions).

---

#### **D. Data Processing**
- **Stream Processing**:
  - Real-time classification of incoming transactions using Apache Kafka.
- **Batch Processing**:
  - Periodic recalculations of spending trends using Apache Spark.

---

#### **E. Security**
1. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
2. **Tokenization**:
   - Store tokens instead of raw account credentials.
3. **Authentication**:
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user login.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - Implement PCI DSS standards for handling payment data.

### **5. Scalability Considerations**

#### **A. Horizontal Scaling**
- Use load balancers to distribute requests across multiple backend servers.
- Scale storage using sharding and replication.

#### **B. Asynchronous Processing**
- Process categorization and analytics in the background to reduce user-facing latency.

#### **C. Data Partitioning**
- Partition transaction data by user ID for efficient access and storage.

#### **D. Caching**
- Cache frequently accessed queries (e.g., recent transactions) to reduce database load.

---

### **6. Failure Handling**
1. **API Failures**:
   - Retry with exponential backoff for bank API requests.
2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Use distributed transactions or eventual consistency to ensure data accuracy.
3. **User Alerts**:
   - Notify users in case of integration failures.

### **7. Example User Journey**

#### **Step 1: Account Linking**
- User links a bank account via OAuth2.
- System fetches transaction data through Plaid APIs.

#### **Step 2: Spending Overview**
- System categorizes transactions and provides a breakdown of spending.
- User views a chart showing spending trends.

#### **Step 3: Recommendations**
- System highlights an unused subscription and suggests cancellation.
- User sets a monthly budget based on spending habits.
