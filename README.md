# Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing Python solutions for the problems presented in the book **"Cracking the Coding Interview"** by *Gayle Laakmann McDowell*.

## Overview

In this repository, I have attempted to solve every problem present in the book using Python programming language. Each problem solution is organized into directories based on the chapters in the book. Within each chapter directory, you will find individual Python files containing solutions for the corresponding problems.

## Repository Structure
- Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings
- Chapter 2: Linked Lists
- Chapter 3: Stacks and Queues
- Chapter 4: Trees and Graphs
- Chapter 5: Bit Manipulation
- Chapter 6: Math and Logic Puzzles
- Chapter 7: Object-Oriented Design
- Chapter 8: Recursion and Dynamic Programming
- Chapter 9: System Design and Scalability
- Chapter 10: Sorting and Searching
- Chapter 11: Testing
- Chapter 12: C and C++
- Chapter 13: Java
- Chapter 14: Databases
- Chapter 15: Threads and Locks
- Chapter 16: Moderate
- Chapter 17: Hard


## Contents

Each directory contains problem solutions along with detailed explanations including:

- **Approach:** Explanation of the approach or algorithm used to solve the problem.
- **Intuition:** Insights or reasoning behind the chosen approach.
- **Code:** Python code implementation of the solution.
- **Time Complexity:** Analysis of the time complexity of the solution.
- **Space Complexity:** Analysis of the space complexity of the solution.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have an alternative solution, found a bug, or want to improve the existing solutions, feel free to open a pull request.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions are provided as learning resources and may not be the most optimized or efficient solutions for every problem. The aim is to understand the concepts and approaches to solve each problem.
