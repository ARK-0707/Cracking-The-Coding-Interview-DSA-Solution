# 3.6 Animal Shelter

## Description
An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People can adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all the animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat and will receive the oldest animal of that type. They cannot select which specific animal they would like. 

### Implementation Details
The `Shelter` class uses two separate deques (double-ended queues) to maintain dogs and cats. Each animal is represented by an instance of the `Animal` class, which holds the animal's name, type, and arrival order. 

Here's a breakdown of the methods implemented:

- **`enqueue(name, type)`**: Adds a new animal (dog or cat) to the shelter. The animal is given an order number to track its arrival time.
- **`dequeueAny()`**: Removes and returns the oldest animal from the shelter, whether it is a dog or a cat.
- **`dequeueDog()`**: Removes and returns the oldest dog from the shelter.
- **`dequeueCat()`**: Removes and returns the oldest cat from the shelter.

### Example Usage
```python
shelter = Shelter()
shelter.enqueue("Buddy", "dog")
shelter.enqueue("Mittens", "cat")
shelter.enqueue("Rex", "dog")
shelter.enqueue("Whiskers", "cat")

print("Dequeue Any:", shelter.dequeueAny())  # Should return Buddy (oldest animal)
print("Dequeue Dog:", shelter.dequeueDog())  # Should return Rex (oldest dog)
print("Dequeue Cat:", shelter.dequeueCat())  # Should return Mittens (oldest cat)
print("Dequeue Any:", shelter.dequeueAny())  # Should return Whiskers (remaining animal)
```

### Explanation
This implementation maintains two separate deques for dogs and cats, ensuring that the oldest animal of each type can be efficiently dequeued. The `order` attribute in the `Animal` class ensures that the oldest animal (across both types) can be identified and dequeued. The deques facilitate efficient append and pop operations from both ends, ensuring that enqueue and dequeue operations run in constant time \(O(1)\).

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Each operation (`enqueue`, `dequeueAny`, `dequeueDog`, `dequeueCat`) runs in constant time \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of animals in the shelter.

### Python Code

```python
from collections import deque

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, type, order):
        self.name = name
        self.type = type
        self.order = order

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.type.capitalize()}({self.name}, order={self.order})"

class Shelter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dogs = deque()
        self.cats = deque()
        self.order = 0

    def enqueue(self, name, type):
        animal = Animal(name, type, self.order)
        self.order += 1

        if type == "dog":
            self.dogs.append(animal)
        elif type == "cat":
            self.cats.append(animal)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Animal type must be 'dog' or 'cat'")

    def dequeueAny(self):
        if not self.dogs and not self.cats:
            return None
        elif not self.dogs:
            return self.dequeueCat()
        elif not self.cats:
            return self.dequeueDog()

        dog = self.dogs[0]
        cat = self.cats[0]

        if dog.order < cat.order:
            return self.dequeueDog()
        else:
            return self.dequeueCat()

    def dequeueDog(self):
        if self.dogs:
            return self.dogs.popleft()
        return None

    def dequeueCat(self):
        if self.cats:
            return self.cats.popleft()
        return None

# Example usage:
shelter = Shelter()
shelter.enqueue("Buddy", "dog")
shelter.enqueue("Mittens", "cat")
shelter.enqueue("Rex", "dog")
shelter.enqueue("Whiskers", "cat")

print("Dequeue Any:", shelter.dequeueAny())  # Should return Buddy (oldest animal)
print("Dequeue Dog:", shelter.dequeueDog())  # Should return Rex (oldest dog)
print("Dequeue Cat:", shelter.dequeueCat())  # Should return Mittens (oldest cat)
print("Dequeue Any:", shelter.dequeueAny())  # Should return Whiskers (remaining animal)
```

This implementation effectively demonstrates how to manage an animal shelter's operations, maintaining efficient and straightforward methods for enqueuing and dequeuing animals based on their arrival time and type.
