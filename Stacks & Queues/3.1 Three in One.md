# 3.1 Three in One

## Description
You can implement three stacks using a single array by dividing the array into three segments and maintaining separate indices for each stack. This approach ensures that each stack operates independently within the bounds allocated to it.

### Implementation Details
The `ThreeStacks` class initializes with a specified stack size and uses an array that can accommodate three times this size. It also maintains an array `tops` to keep track of the top element index for each stack. Here's a breakdown of the methods implemented:

- **`is_full(stack_num)`**: Checks if a particular stack (`stack_num`) is full.
- **`is_empty(stack_num)`**: Checks if a particular stack (`stack_num`) is empty.
- **`push(stack_num, value)`**: Pushes a value onto the specified stack (`stack_num`). It calculates the correct index based on the stack number and the current top index for that stack.
- **`pop(stack_num)`**: Pops the top element from the specified stack (`stack_num`) and returns it. It also clears the value from the array.
- **`peek(stack_num)`**: Returns the top element of the specified stack (`stack_num`) without removing it.

### Example Usage
```python
stacks = ThreeStacks(3)  # Each stack can hold up to 3 elements
stacks.push(0, 1)
stacks.push(0, 2)
stacks.push(1, 10)
stacks.push(2, 20)

print(stacks.pop(0))  # Output: 2
print(stacks.peek(1))  # Output: 10
print(stacks.pop(2))  # Output: 20
```

### Explanation
This implementation efficiently uses a single array to simulate three independent stacks by partitioning the array and managing the top indices separately for each stack. Operations like push, pop, and peek are implemented to ensure that they operate within the boundaries of each stack segment.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Each operation (push, pop, peek) operates in constant time \(O(1)\), as they involve simple array indexing and updates.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the total size of the array used to simulate the three stacks.

### Python Code

```python
class ThreeStacks:
    def __init__(self, stack_size):
        self.stack_size = stack_size
        self.array = [None] * (stack_size * 3)  # Single array to hold three stacks
        self.tops = [-1, -1, -1]  # Initialize tops of three stacks

    def is_full(self, stack_num):
        return self.tops[stack_num] + 1 >= self.stack_size

    def is_empty(self, stack_num):
        return self.tops[stack_num] == -1

    def push(self, stack_num, value):
        if self.is_full(stack_num):
            raise Exception(f"Stack {stack_num} is full")
        self.tops[stack_num] += 1
        index = stack_num * self.stack_size + self.tops[stack_num]
        self.array[index] = value

    def pop(self, stack_num):
        if self.is_empty(stack_num):
            raise Exception(f"Stack {stack_num} is empty")
        index = stack_num * self.stack_size + self.tops[stack_num]
        value = self.array[index]
        self.array[index] = None  # Clear the value
        self.tops[stack_num] -= 1
        return value

    def peek(self, stack_num):
        if self.is_empty(stack_num):
            raise Exception(f"Stack {stack_num} is empty")
        index = stack_num * self.stack_size + self.tops[stack_num]
        return self.array[index]


if __name__ == '__main__':
    stacks = ThreeStacks(3)  # Each stack can hold up to 3 elements

    # Push elements onto each stack
    stacks.push(0, 1)
    stacks.push(0, 2)
    stacks.push(1, 10)
    stacks.push(2, 20)

    # Pop and peek operations
    print(stacks.pop(0))  # Output: 2
    print(stacks.peek(1))  # Output: 10
    print(stacks.pop(2))  # Output: 20
```

This implementation effectively demonstrates how to manage three independent stacks using a single array in Python, ensuring efficient and straightforward operations for stack manipulation. Each stack operates within its predefined segment of the array, allowing for clear separation and management of stack elements.
