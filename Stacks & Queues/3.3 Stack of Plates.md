# Stack of Plates

## Description
The `SetOfStacks` data structure mimics a stack of plates where a new stack is started once the previous stack exceeds a specified capacity. It maintains multiple stacks internally and provides methods to push elements onto the stack, pop elements off the stack, and specifically pop elements from any specific sub-stack.

### Implementation Details
The `SetOfStacks` class uses a deque of deques (`self.stacks`) to manage multiple stacks. Each sub-stack is represented by a deque and is created or extended as needed when elements are pushed onto it. Here's a breakdown of the methods implemented:

- **`push(value)`**: Adds a value onto the current sub-stack. If the current sub-stack exceeds the `capacity`, a new sub-stack is created.
- **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the top value from the current sub-stack. If the current sub-stack becomes empty after popping, it is removed from `self.stacks`.
- **`popAt(index)`**: Removes and returns the top value from the sub-stack at the specified `index`. If `index` is out of bounds or the sub-stack at `index` is empty, it returns `None`.

### Example Usage
```python
stacks = SetOfStacks(3)  # Each sub-stack can hold up to 3 elements

stacks.push(1)
stacks.push(2)
stacks.push(3)
stacks.push(4)
stacks.push(5)
stacks.push(6)
stacks.push(7)

print(stacks.pop())  # Output: 7
print(stacks.popAt(0))  # Output: 3
print(stacks.popAt(1))  # Output: 6
```

### Explanation
This implementation ensures that operations such as pushing onto a stack, popping from the main stack, and popping from a specific sub-stack (`popAt`) behave similarly to a single stack. It maintains the integrity of each sub-stack's capacity and manages them accordingly.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `push(value)`: Amortized \(O(1)\) for adding to the stack. Creating a new stack (when necessary) is \(O(1)\).
  - `pop()`: Amortized \(O(1)\) for removing from the stack. Removing an empty stack (when necessary) is \(O(1)\).
  - `popAt(index)`: \(O(1)\) for removing from a specific sub-stack.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the total number of elements across all sub-stacks.

### Python Code

```python
from collections import deque

class SetOfStacks:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.stacks = deque()

    def push(self, value):
        if not self.stacks or len(self.stacks[-1]) >= self.capacity:
            self.stacks.append(deque())
        self.stacks[-1].append(value)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.stacks:
            return None
        value = self.stacks[-1].pop()
        if not self.stacks[-1]:
            self.stacks.pop()
        return value

    def popAt(self, index):
        if index < 0 or index >= len(self.stacks):
            return None
        if not self.stacks[index]:
            return None
        value = self.stacks[index].pop()
        if not self.stacks[index]:
            del self.stacks[index]
        return value

# Example usage:
stacks = SetOfStacks(3)
stacks.push(1)
stacks.push(2)
stacks.push(3)
stacks.push(4)
stacks.push(5)
stacks.push(6)
stacks.push(7)

print(stacks.pop())  # Output: 7
print(stacks.popAt(0))  # Output: 3
print(stacks.popAt(1))  # Output: 6
```

This implementation effectively manages multiple stacks with a dynamically increasing number of sub-stacks based on a specified capacity. It ensures efficient operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements within each stack and sub-stack.
