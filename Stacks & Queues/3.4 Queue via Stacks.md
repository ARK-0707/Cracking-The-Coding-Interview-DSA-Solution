# Queue via Stacks

## Description
The `MyQueue` class implements a queue using two stacks, where elements are enqueued onto one stack (`stack1`) and dequeued from another stack (`stack2`). This ensures that the first-in element is the first-out, mimicking the behavior of a queue.

### Implementation Details
The `MyQueue` class utilizes two `deque` objects from Python's `collections` module:
- **`stack1`**: Used for enqueue operations.
- **`stack2`**: Used for dequeue operations.

Here's a breakdown of the methods implemented:
- **`enqueue(value)`**: Adds an element to `stack1`.
- **`dequeue()`**: If `stack2` is empty, elements are moved from `stack1` to `stack2` to reverse the order and simulate FIFO. Then, the top element of `stack2` is removed and returned.

### Example Usage
```python
Queue = MyQueue()
Queue.enqueue(1)
Queue.enqueue(2)
Queue.enqueue(3)
Queue.enqueue(4)

print(Queue.dequeue())        # 1
print(Queue.dequeue())        # 2
print(Queue.dequeue())        # 3
print(Queue.dequeue())        # 4
```

### Explanation
This implementation ensures that enqueue operations are efficient (amortized \(O(1)\) time complexity), while dequeue operations, although potentially involving a transfer between stacks, are also efficient on average (amortized \(O(1)\) time complexity). This approach leverages the stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior to achieve the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) behavior required for a queue.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - `enqueue(value)`: Amortized \(O(1)\) time complexity.
  - `dequeue()`: Amortized \(O(1)\) time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the queue.

### Python Code

```python
from collections import deque

class MyQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack1 = deque()
        self.stack2 = deque()

    def enqueue(self, value):
        self.stack1.append(value)

    def dequeue(self):
        if len(self.stack2) == 0:
            while self.stack1:
                self.stack2.append(self.stack1.pop())
        return self.stack2.pop() if self.stack2 else None

# Example usage:
Queue = MyQueue()
Queue.enqueue(1)
Queue.enqueue(2)
Queue.enqueue(3)
Queue.enqueue(4)

print(Queue.dequeue())        # 1
print(Queue.dequeue())        # 2
print(Queue.dequeue())        # 3
print(Queue.dequeue())        # 4
```

This implementation effectively demonstrates how to create a queue using two stacks in Python, ensuring that enqueue and dequeue operations maintain the desired FIFO behavior efficiently.
