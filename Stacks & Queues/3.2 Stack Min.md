# 3.2 Stack Min

## Description
This implementation enhances a stack data structure to support the `push`, `pop`, and `min` operations in constant time \(O(1)\). The `min` operation retrieves the minimum element currently in the stack.

### Implementation Details
The `Stack` class is designed using a deque (double-ended queue) for the main stack operations and another deque `min_stack` to keep track of the minimum elements.

- **`push(val)`**: Pushes a value onto the stack. If `min_stack` is empty or the new value is smaller than or equal to the current minimum, it pushes the value onto `min_stack` as well.
  
- **`pop()`**: Removes the top element from both `stack` and `min_stack`.

- **`min()`**: Returns the top element of `min_stack`, which represents the current minimum value in the stack.

### Example Usage
```python
s = Stack()
s.push(9)
s.push(4)
s.push(5)
s.push(3)
s.push(10)
print("Stack:", s.printStack())
print("Min Stack:", s.printMinStack())
s.pop()
print("Stack after pop:", s.printStack())
print("Min Value in the stack is: ", s.min())
```

### Explanation
This implementation uses two deques to maintain the stack and track the minimum element efficiently. Each operation (`push`, `pop`, `min`) operates in constant time \(O(1)\) due to the properties of deques in Python, which allow appending and popping from both ends in constant time.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Each operation (`push`, `pop`, `min`) runs in constant time \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the stack, due to the storage of elements in the deques.

### Python Code

```python
from collections import deque

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = deque()
        self.min_stack = deque()

    def push(self, val):
        self.stack.append(val)
        if len(self.min_stack) == 0 or val <= self.min_stack[-1]:
            self.min_stack.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        if len(self.stack) == 0:
            return None
        if self.stack[-1] == self.min_stack[-1]:
            self.min_stack.pop()
        return self.stack.pop()

    def min(self):
        if len(self.min_stack) == 0:
            return None
        return self.min_stack[-1]

    def printStack(self):
        return list(self.stack)

    def printMinStack(self):
        return list(self.min_stack)

# Example usage:
s = Stack()
s.push(9)
s.push(4)
s.push(5)
s.push(3)
s.push(10)

print("Stack:", s.printStack())
print("Min Stack:", s.printMinStack())

s.pop()
print("Stack after pop:", s.printStack())
print("Min Value in the stack is: ", s.min())
```

This implementation of a stack with a `min` function ensures efficient operations while maintaining constant-time complexity for all essential operations. It provides a straightforward way to manage a stack with additional functionality to track and retrieve the minimum element efficiently.
