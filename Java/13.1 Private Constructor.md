# 13.1 Private Constructor

## Problem Description
In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

---

## Solution

Making a constructor private has a profound effect on inheritance and the usability of a class in object-oriented programming (OOP). Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### 1. **Restricting Class Instantiation**
   - When a constructor is private, it prevents external code from instantiating the class directly. 
   - Only the code inside the class itself can create instances. This is commonly used in design patterns like the **Singleton Pattern** to ensure that only one instance of a class exists.

---

### 2. **Impact on Inheritance**
   - **Subclassing Prohibited:**
     If a class has only private constructors, it cannot be subclassed (i.e., no class can extend it). 
     - When a subclass is created, it must invoke the constructor of its superclass as the first statement in its constructor (`super()`). 
     - If the superclass constructor is private, this invocation is not possible, and the compiler (or interpreter) will throw an error.
   - **Making the Class Final:**
     Effectively, a class with only private constructors behaves like a `final` class (a class that cannot be extended), even if the `final` keyword is not explicitly used.

---

### 3. **Common Use Cases for Private Constructors**
   - **Singleton Design Pattern:**
     - Ensures that only one instance of a class exists.
     - Example:
       ```java
       public class Singleton {
           private static Singleton instance;
           
           private Singleton() {
               // Private constructor
           }
           
           public static Singleton getInstance() {
               if (instance == null) {
                   instance = new Singleton();
               }
               return instance;
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Utility Classes:**
     - Classes that provide static methods and fields often have private constructors to prevent instantiation.
     - Example:
       ```java
       public class MathUtils {
           private MathUtils() {
               // Prevent instantiation
           }
           
           public static int add(int a, int b) {
               return a + b;
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Factory Patterns:**
     - Used to control the instantiation process and hide object creation logic.
     - Example:
       ```java
       public class ShapeFactory {
           private ShapeFactory() {
               // Prevent direct instantiation
           }
           
           public static Shape createCircle() {
               return new Circle();
           }
           
           public static Shape createSquare() {
               return new Square();
           }
       }
       ```

---

### 4. **Key Benefits**
   - **Encapsulation:** You control how instances of the class are created and ensure the integrity of the class's internal state.
   - **Prevention of Subclassing:** By making the constructor private, you enforce composition over inheritance, encouraging better design practices.
   - **Immutability:** In some cases, private constructors help make classes immutable by controlling instantiation and ensuring objects are created with specific, unmodifiable values.

---

### 5. **Limitations**
   - **No Subclassing:** Private constructors make it impossible to extend the class.
   - **Limited Usability:** The class can only be used in controlled ways, such as through factory methods or static methods. If not designed carefully, this could limit flexibility.

---

### 6. **When to Avoid Private Constructors**
   - If you want to allow subclassing or if the class needs to be extended to add functionality.
   - For classes that are part of an extensible framework or API, where users might need to create custom subclasses.

---

### Summary
A private constructor in a class makes it non-instantiable directly and prohibits inheritance, enforcing strict control over how objects of the class are created and used. It is a powerful feature used in design patterns like Singleton and Factory and to create utility classes.
