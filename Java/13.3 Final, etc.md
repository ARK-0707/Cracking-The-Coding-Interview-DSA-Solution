# 13.3 Final, etc

## Problem Descrition
What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, `finalize`?

---

## Solution

The terms **`final`**, **`finally`**, and **`finalize`** in Java are distinct concepts with different purposes. Here is a detailed explanation in tabular form:

| **Feature**      | **`final`**                                          | **`finally`**                                           | **`finalize`**                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | A keyword used to define constants, prevent inheritance, or prevent method overriding. | A block of code associated with exception handling that ensures execution. | A method used by the garbage collector before object destruction. |
| **Purpose**       | To restrict modifications or extendability.         | To ensure cleanup actions are performed in exception handling. | To provide a mechanism for cleanup before object deallocation. |
| **Usage Context** | Classes, methods, and variables.                    | In `try-catch-finally` blocks.                        | As a method in the `Object` class.                         |
| **Key Functionality** | - `final` **class**: Cannot be subclassed.<br>- `final` **method**: Cannot be overridden.<br>- `final` **variable**: Its value cannot be changed after initialization. | Ensures the `finally` block always executes regardless of what happens in the `try` or `catch` block. | Called by the garbage collector when it determines that there are no more references to an object. |
| **When Executed** | During compilation to impose restrictions.          | At runtime, when a `try-catch-finally` block is executed. | At runtime, just before an object is garbage collected.    |
| **Inheritance Impact** | Restricts extension of classes or overriding of methods. | No impact on inheritance.                             | No impact on inheritance; part of the `Object` class.      |
| **Associated Keywords** | Used with `static` to create constants.        | Used with `try` and `catch` blocks.                   | Overridden in a custom class to implement cleanup logic.   |
| **Common Use Cases** | - Create constants.<br>- Ensure immutability.<br>- Restrict inheritance and method overriding. | - Closing resources like files or database connections.<br>- Ensuring cleanup actions after exceptions. | - Releasing unmanaged resources like file handles.<br>- Logging object destruction (rarely used in practice). |
| **Can it be Overridden?** | - A `final` method cannot be overridden.<br>- `final` classes cannot be subclassed. | No, the `finally` block is not overridden; it is executed as part of the exception handling mechanism. | Yes, `finalize()` can be overridden in custom classes.     |

### Examples for Each:

#### **`final` Example:**

```java
final class Animal { // Cannot be subclassed
    final void sound() { // Cannot be overridden
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal { // Compilation error: Cannot subclass
    // void sound() {} // Compilation error: Cannot override
}
```

#### **`finally` Example:**

```java
public class FinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("In try block");
            int result = 10 / 0; // Throws an exception
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("In catch block");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("In finally block");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
In try block
In catch block
In finally block
```

#### **`finalize` Example:**

```java
public class FinalizeExample {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Object is being garbage collected");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FinalizeExample obj = new FinalizeExample();
        obj = null; // Make object eligible for garbage collection
        System.gc(); // Request JVM to run the garbage collector
    }
}
```
**Output:**
```
Object is being garbage collected
```

### Summary:
- Use **`final`** for defining constants or imposing restrictions on inheritance and overriding.
- Use **`finally`** to ensure cleanup actions in exception handling.
- **`finalize`** is rarely used and has largely been replaced by better resource management tools like `try-with-resources`.
