# 13.2 Return from Finally

## Problem Description
In java, does the `finally` block get executed if we insert a `return` statement inside the try block of a `try-catch-finally`?

---

## Solution

Yes, the `finally` block **will get executed** even if there is a `return` statement inside the `try` block (or the `catch` block) of a `try-catch-finally` construct in Java. 

The purpose of the `finally` block is to ensure that important cleanup actions are performed regardless of what happens in the `try` or `catch` blocks, such as releasing resources or closing files.

---

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Flow of Execution:**
   - If a `return` statement is encountered in the `try` or `catch` block, the control does not immediately return to the calling method. 
   - Before the method exits, the `finally` block is executed.
   - After the `finally` block completes execution, the `return` statement in the `try` or `catch` block is honored, and the method returns.

2. **Example Code:**

   ```java
   public class FinallyWithReturn {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println(demo());
       }

       public static String demo() {
           try {
               System.out.println("In try block");
               return "Returned from try";
           } catch (Exception e) {
               System.out.println("In catch block");
               return "Returned from catch";
           } finally {
               System.out.println("In finally block");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   In try block
   In finally block
   Returned from try
   ```

   - The `try` block's `return` statement is executed, but before the method exits, the `finally` block runs. 
   - Only after the `finally` block completes does the method return the value from the `try` block.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The `finally` block **always** executes, even if there are `return`, `break`, or `continue` statements inside the `try` or `catch` blocks.
   - The only exceptions when `finally` might not execute are:
     - If the JVM crashes.
     - If the `System.exit()` method is called before reaching the `finally` block.

---

### Edge Case: `finally` Overriding `return`

If there is a `return` statement in the `finally` block itself, it will **override** the return value from the `try` or `catch` block. This is considered bad practice, as it makes the code confusing.

Example:

```java
public static String demo() {
    try {
        System.out.println("In try block");
        return "Returned from try";
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("In catch block");
        return "Returned from catch";
    } finally {
        System.out.println("In finally block");
        return "Returned from finally";
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
In try block
In finally block
Returned from finally
```

Here, the `return` in the `finally` block overrides the `return` in the `try` or `catch` block, and the method always returns `"Returned from finally"`.

---

### Summary:
- The `finally` block always executes (except in rare cases like JVM crashes or `System.exit()`).
- Even if there is a `return` in the `try` or `catch` block, the `finally` block is executed before the method returns.
- Avoid using `return` inside the `finally` block to prevent overriding the expected behavior.
