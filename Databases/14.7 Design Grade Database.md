# 14.7 Design Grade Database

## Problem Description
Imagine a simple database storing information for students' grades. Design what this database might look like and provide a SQL query to return a list of the honor roll students (top 10%), sorted by their grade point average.

## Solution

### **Designing a Database for Students' Grades**

For a database storing information about students' grades, we can break it down into the following **entities** and their **relationships**:

### **Entities and Attributes**:

1. **Students**
   - **Attributes**: StudentID (Primary Key), FirstName, LastName, Email, DateOfBirth
   - Represents individual students in the system.

2. **Courses**
   - **Attributes**: CourseID (Primary Key), CourseName, Department, Instructor
   - Represents courses that students can take.

3. **Grades**
   - **Attributes**: GradeID (Primary Key), StudentID (Foreign Key), CourseID (Foreign Key), Grade
   - Stores the grades for students in specific courses. The grade could be a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) or a numeric grade (e.g., 90, 85).

4. **GPA (Grade Point Average)**
   - This can be derived from the grades of each student and represents the overall academic performance of the student. The GPA is typically calculated as a weighted average of the grades for each course.

### **Database Schema**:

```sql
-- Students Table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    DateOfBirth DATE
);

-- Courses Table
CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100),
    Department VARCHAR(100),
    Instructor VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Grades Table
CREATE TABLE Grades (
    GradeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    Grade DECIMAL(5,2),  -- Numeric grade for simplicity (e.g., 85.5)
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
```

---

### **Honor Roll Calculation**

To determine the **top 10% of students** based on their **Grade Point Average (GPA)**, we first need to calculate the GPA for each student. We will assume a simple grading scale where:
- 90 and above = A (4.0)
- 80 to 89 = B (3.0)
- 70 to 79 = C (2.0)
- 60 to 69 = D (1.0)
- Below 60 = F (0.0)

For the purpose of the query, we will calculate the GPA based on the numeric grades of each student. Then, we'll return the students who fall in the **top 10%** based on their GPA.

---

### **SQL Query for Honor Roll Students (Top 10%)**

1. **Step 1**: Calculate the GPA for each student. GPA can be calculated as the average grade across all their courses.

2. **Step 2**: Identify the top 10% of students based on their GPA.

Hereâ€™s the SQL query that performs this:

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate GPA for each student
WITH StudentGPA AS (
    SELECT
        s.StudentID,
        s.FirstName,
        s.LastName,
        AVG(g.Grade) AS GPA  -- Calculate average grade for each student
    FROM Students s
    JOIN Grades g ON s.StudentID = g.StudentID
    GROUP BY s.StudentID
),

-- Step 2: Calculate the cutoff for top 10% of students based on GPA
RankedStudents AS (
    SELECT
        sg.StudentID,
        sg.FirstName,
        sg.LastName,
        sg.GPA,
        PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sg.GPA DESC) AS Rank -- Rank students by GPA
    FROM StudentGPA sg
)

-- Step 3: Select the top 10% of students based on GPA
SELECT
    rs.StudentID,
    rs.FirstName,
    rs.LastName,
    rs.GPA
FROM RankedStudents rs
WHERE rs.Rank <= 0.10  -- Top 10% based on GPA
ORDER BY rs.GPA DESC;  -- Sort by GPA in descending order
```

### **Explanation of the Query**:

1. **StudentGPA CTE**: 
   - This **Common Table Expression (CTE)** calculates the GPA for each student by averaging the grades across all their courses. We join the `Students` and `Grades` tables on `StudentID` to get the grades for each student.

2. **RankedStudents CTE**:
   - We use the `PERCENT_RANK()` window function to rank the students by their GPA in descending order (higher GPA students get a lower rank value). The rank value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is the highest GPA and 1 is the lowest.

3. **Main Query**:
   - In the main query, we filter the students whose rank is less than or equal to 0.10, meaning they are in the top 10% of the students by GPA.
   - The result is sorted by GPA in descending order to list the top students first.

### **Sample Data**:

Let's assume we have the following data in our tables:

**Students Table**:
| StudentID | FirstName | LastName | Email            |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| 1         | John      | Doe      | john.doe@email.com|
| 2         | Jane      | Smith    | jane.smith@email.com|
| 3         | Alice     | Johnson  | alice.johnson@email.com|
| 4         | Bob       | Brown    | bob.brown@email.com|

**Grades Table**:
| GradeID | StudentID | CourseID | Grade |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1       | 1         | 101      | 90    |
| 2       | 1         | 102      | 85    |
| 3       | 2         | 101      | 95    |
| 4       | 2         | 102      | 92    |
| 5       | 3         | 101      | 88    |
| 6       | 3         | 102      | 84    |
| 7       | 4         | 101      | 70    |
| 8       | 4         | 102      | 75    |

After running the query, we would get a list of students who are in the top 10% by GPA.

### **Conclusion**:

This query provides a way to identify the **honor roll students**, i.e., those in the **top 10%** of all students based on their GPA. The use of **window functions** like `PERCENT_RANK()` allows us to rank students efficiently, and the query is flexible enough to be adjusted based on different grading schemes or definitions of the top 10%.
