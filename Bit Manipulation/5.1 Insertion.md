# 5.1 Insertion

## Problem Description
You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

### Approach
1. **Clear bits from position j to i in N**: To do this, create a mask that has all bits set to 1 except for the bits between i and j, which are set to 0.
2. **Shift M to the correct position**: Shift M to align it with the cleared section of N.
3. **Combine N and M**: Combine N with the shifted version of M using a bitwise OR.

### Example Usage
```python
def insertBits(N, M, i, j):
    # Create a mask to clear bits i through j in N
    all_ones = ~0  # Sequence of all 1s (binary: 111...111)
    
    # Mask for the left side: 1s before position j
    left = all_ones << (j + 1)
    
    # Mask for the right side: 1s after position i
    right = (1 << i) - 1
    
    # Combine left and right to create the full mask
    mask = left | right
    
    # Clear bits j through i in N by using the mask
    N_cleared = N & mask
    
    # Shift M to the correct position
    M_shifted = M << i
    
    # Combine N_cleared with the shifted M
    return N_cleared | M_shifted

# Example usage
N = int('10000000000', 2)  # N = 1024 in binary (10000000000)
M = int('10011', 2)        # M = 19 in binary (10011)
i = 2
j = 6

result = insertBits(N, M, i, j)
print(bin(result))  # Output should be 0b10001001100 (binary representation of 1100)
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: We create a mask that has all bits set to 1 except for the range from i to j, which is set to 0.
    - `left = ~0 << (j + 1)`: All 1s from the left of bit `j`.
    - `right = (1 << i) - 1`: All 1s from the right of bit `i`.
    - The final mask clears the bits from i to j.
  
- **Step 2**: Shift M by `i` positions to align it with the cleared space in N.

- **Step 3**: Use bitwise OR to merge `N_cleared` and `M_shifted`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as bit manipulation operations are constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a few variables are used.

This implementation allows inserting M into N at the specified positions, and the result is printed in binary format for clarity.
