# 5.6 Conversion

## Problem Description
Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.

### Example
Input: 
- A = 29 (binary: `11101`)
- B = 15 (binary: `01111`)

Output: 2

### Approach

1. **XOR Operation**: 
   - To determine which bits are different between `A` and `B`, perform the XOR (`^`) operation on both numbers. This will result in a number where each bit is `1` if the corresponding bits in `A` and `B` are different, and `0` if they are the same.
   
2. **Count the 1s**: 
   - After obtaining the XOR result, count the number of `1`s in its binary representation. Each `1` indicates a position where the bits differ between `A` and `B`, meaning a bit flip would be required at that position.

### Example Usage
```python
def convert(A, B):
    # XOR between A and B gives a number where 1s represent different bits
    C = A ^ B
    count = 0
    
    # Count the number of 1s in C
    while C:
        count += C & 1  # Add 1 if the rightmost bit is 1
        C >>= 1         # Right shift to process the next bit

    return count

# Example usage
print(convert(29, 15))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation:

- **Step 1**: Perform the XOR operation between `A` and `B`:
    - A = `11101` (binary for 29)
    - B = `01111` (binary for 15)
    - XOR result: `10010`
    
    In binary, the XOR result `10010` indicates that the bits in positions 1 and 4 are different between `A` and `B`.

- **Step 2**: Count the `1`s in the XOR result:
    - The number `10010` has two `1`s, which means two bits differ between `A` and `B`. Thus, you would need to flip two bits in `A` to convert it into `B`.

- **Step 3**: We use a simple loop to count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the XOR result by repeatedly checking the least significant bit (using `& 1`) and right-shifting the number (`>>= 1`).

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(b), where `b` is the number of bits in the integers `A` and `B` (usually 32 or 64). The loop runs until all bits have been processed, but since the number of bits in a typical integer is fixed, this is effectively constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables to track the count and perform bit manipulations.

This function efficiently determines the number of bit flips required by leveraging the XOR operation and counting the resulting 1s, ensuring a simple and optimized solution for the problem.
