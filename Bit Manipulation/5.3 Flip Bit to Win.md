## 5.3: Flip Bit to Win

### Problem Statement
You have an integer, and you can flip exactly one bit from 0 to 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.

### Example:
- Input: `1775` (which is `11011101111` in binary)
- Output: `8`

### Approach:
1. **Binary Representation**: Convert the given number to its binary form.
2. **Traverse the Binary String**: Traverse the binary string, keeping track of consecutive sequences of `1`s. Every time you encounter a `0`, you calculate the possible length of `1`s that can be achieved by flipping that `0` to `1`.
3. **Max Sequence Calculation**:
    - You need to track the length of the current sequence of `1`s (`current_length`).
    - You also need to track the length of the previous sequence of `1`s before encountering the `0` (`previous_length`).
    - When you encounter a `0`, calculate the maximum sequence length by summing `previous_length` and `current_length`, plus one (for the flipped bit).
4. **Edge Case**: If there are no `0`s, return the length of the sequence directly.

### Code:

```python
def flipToWin(num):
    # Convert the number to its binary representation
    binary = bin(num)[2:]  # Removing the '0b' prefix from the binary string

    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    previous_length = 0
    found_zero = False  # To check if we found at least one zero to flip

    for bit in binary:
        if bit == '1':
            # Increment current sequence length of 1s
            current_length += 1
        else:
            # Update max length when encountering a zero
            max_length = max(max_length, previous_length + current_length)
            previous_length = current_length  # Previous becomes current
            current_length = 0  # Reset current length to start a new sequence
            found_zero = True  # Found a zero that can be flipped

    # Final comparison to get the max length considering one possible flip
    max_length = max(max_length, previous_length + current_length + 1 if found_zero else current_length)
    
    return max_length


# Example usage
print(flipToWin(1775))  # Output: 8
```

### Explanation:
1. **Binary Conversion**: We first convert the integer `num` to its binary string representation using Python's `bin()` function and remove the `'0b'` prefix.
2. **Tracking the Sequence**:
    - `current_length` tracks the current consecutive sequence of `1`s.
    - `previous_length` stores the length of the previous sequence of `1`s before the last `0`.
3. **When `0` is Encountered**: When we hit a `0`, we check if flipping that `0` can yield a longer sequence by adding `previous_length` + `current_length`, and store the result in `max_length`.
4. **Final Adjustment**: After the loop, we do one last comparison to ensure we didn't miss any longer sequence towards the end of the binary representation.

### Output:
```python
8
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(b), where `b` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the integer `num`. We traverse the binary string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only store a few variables for tracking sequences and the result.
