## 5.4: Next Number

### Problem Statement:
Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1s bits in their binary representation.

### Approach:

1. **Next Largest**:
   - Traverse from the least significant bit to find the first `0` that has `1`s to its right.
   - Flip the `0` to `1` and shift the `1`s to the right of that position to the least significant positions.
   
2. **Next Smallest**:
   - Traverse from the least significant bit to find the first `1` that has `0`s to its right.
   - Flip the `1` to `0` and shift the `1`s to the left of that position to the most significant positions possible.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def nextLargestNumber(num):
    c = num
    c0 = c1 = 0

    # Count trailing zeros (c0) and ones (c1)
    while ((c & 1) == 0) and (c != 0):
        c0 += 1
        c >>= 1

    while (c & 1) == 1:
        c1 += 1
        c >>= 1

    # If there's no room to flip the next bit, return -1
    if c0 + c1 == 31 or c0 + c1 == 0:
        return -1

    pos = c0 + c1  # Position of the rightmost non-trailing zero
    num |= (1 << pos)  # Flip the rightmost non-trailing zero to 1
    num &= ~((1 << pos) - 1)  # Clear all bits to the right of pos
    num |= (1 << (c1 - 1)) - 1  # Insert (c1-1) ones on the right

    return num


def nextSmallestNumber(num):
    temp = num
    c0 = c1 = 0

    # Count trailing ones (c1)
    while (temp & 1) == 1:
        c1 += 1
        temp >>= 1

    # If no smaller number is possible
    if temp == 0:
        return -1

    # Count zeros (c0)
    while ((temp & 1) == 0) and (temp != 0):
        c0 += 1
        temp >>= 1

    pos = c0 + c1  # Position of the rightmost non-trailing one
    num &= ((~0) << (pos + 1))  # Clear all bits from pos onwards
    mask = (1 << (c1 + 1)) - 1  # Insert (c1+1) ones on the right
    num |= mask << (c0 - 1)  # Shift the mask appropriately

    return num


def nextNumber(num):
    nextLargest = nextLargestNumber(num)
    nextSmallest = nextSmallestNumber(num)
    return nextSmallest, nextLargest


# Example usage
num = 13948  # Binary: 11011001111100
next_smallest, next_largest = nextNumber(num)
print(f"Next smallest: {next_smallest} (Binary: {bin(next_smallest)})")
print(f"Next largest: {next_largest} (Binary: {bin(next_largest)})")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Next Largest**:
   - Count trailing zeros (`c0`) and trailing ones (`c1`) from the least significant bit.
   - Find the position where a `0` can be flipped to `1` and make the adjustment to the right of the flip.
   
2. **Next Smallest**:
   - Count trailing ones (`c1`) followed by trailing zeros (`c0`).
   - Find the first `1` to flip to `0`, and rearrange bits to the right accordingly.

### Example Execution:

Given `num = 13948` (Binary: `11011001111100`):

- **Next Smallest**: 
  - Output: `13946` (Binary: `11011001111010`)
  
- **Next Largest**: 
  - Output: `13967` (Binary: `11011010001111`)

### Output:
```python
Next smallest: 13946 (Binary: 0b11011001111010)
Next largest: 13967 (Binary: 0b11011010001111)
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(b), where `b` is the number of bits in the integer `num`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a few variables are used for tracking.
