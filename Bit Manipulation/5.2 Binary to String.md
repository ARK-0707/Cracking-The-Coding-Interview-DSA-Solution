## Problem 5.2: Binary to String

### Problem Statement
Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR".

### Approach
1. **Binary Representation**: Numbers between 0 and 1 can be represented in binary similar to how integers are represented. For example, the binary fraction `0.625` can be represented as `0.101` because:
    - \( 0.625 \times 2 = 1.25 \) → first digit is 1.
    - Subtract 1 → \( 0.25 \times 2 = 0.5 \) → second digit is 0.
    - \( 0.5 \times 2 = 1.0 \) → third digit is 1.
2. **Precision Limitation**: If the binary representation requires more than 32 characters (including the "0."), it should return an error.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the number is not between 0 and 1.

### Code

```python
def binaryToString(num):
    # If num is not between 0 and 1, it's invalid for this problem
    if num <= 0 or num >= 1:
        return "ERROR"

    binary_rep = "0."

    # Loop to build the binary representation
    while num > 0:
        # Limiting the binary representation to 32 characters
        if len(binary_rep) >= 34:  # 32 chars max, including "0."
            return "ERROR"

        num *= 2
        if num >= 1:
            binary_rep += "1"
            num -= 1
        else:
            binary_rep += "0"

    return binary_rep


# Example usage
print(binaryToString(0.72))   # Output: ERROR (since binary can't represent it within 32 characters)
print(binaryToString(0.625))  # Output: 0.101
```

### Explanation:
1. **Validation**: If the number is not between 0 and 1, we return an error.
2. **Binary Conversion**:
    - Multiply the number by 2. If the result is 1 or greater, append '1' and subtract 1 from the number.
    - If the result is less than 1, append '0' and continue.
    - Repeat until the number becomes 0 or the length of the binary representation exceeds 32 characters.
3. **Limiting to 32 Characters**: We check if the binary representation exceeds 32 characters and return an error if it does.
   
### Output:
```python
ERROR
0.101
```

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), as the loop runs at most 32 times (constant time).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we store only a few variables and the binary string.
