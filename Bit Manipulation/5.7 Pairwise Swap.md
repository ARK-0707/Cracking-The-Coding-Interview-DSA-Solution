# 5.7 Pairwise Swap

## Problem Description
Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on).

### Approach
1. **Mask for Odd and Even Bits**: 
   - To extract the even bits, use a mask with binary `01010101010101010101010101010101`, which is `0x55555555` in hexadecimal.
   - To extract the odd bits, use a mask with binary `10101010101010101010101010101010`, which is `0xAAAAAAAA` in hexadecimal.

2. **Shift the Bits**: 
   - To swap the bits, right shift the odd bits by 1 (moving them to even positions), and left shift the even bits by 1 (moving them to odd positions).

3. **Combine the Results**: 
   - Use the bitwise OR (`|`) to combine the shifted odd and even bits, which effectively swaps them.

### Example Usage
```python
def swap_odd_even_bits(num):
    # Mask for odd bits (0xAAAAAAAA) and shift them right by 1
    odd_bits_shifted = (num & 0xAAAAAAAA) >> 1
    
    # Mask for even bits (0x55555555) and shift them left by 1
    even_bits_shifted = (num & 0x55555555) << 1
    
    # Combine the shifted odd and even bits using bitwise OR
    return odd_bits_shifted | even_bits_shifted

# Example usage
num = 23  # Binary: 10111
swapped = swap_odd_even_bits(num)
print(f"Original: {num} (Binary: {bin(num)})")
print(f"Swapped: {swapped} (Binary: {bin(swapped)})")
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: Use two masks:
    - `0xAAAAAAAA`: This mask has `1`s in all odd positions (`10101010...`), which helps extract the odd bits.
    - `0x55555555`: This mask has `1`s in all even positions (`01010101...`), which helps extract the even bits.

- **Step 2**: Perform bit shifts:
    - For odd bits: Right shift them by 1 (`>> 1`) to move them to even positions.
    - For even bits: Left shift them by 1 (`<< 1`) to move them to odd positions.

- **Step 3**: Combine the shifted bits using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's take the number `23` (`10111` in binary):
- **Odd bits**: In `10111`, the odd bits are `1`s at positions 1 and 3 (counting from the right, starting at 0). Using the mask `0xAAAAAAAA` and shifting right by 1 gives us `01001`.
- **Even bits**: The even bits are `1` at position 0 and `0`s at positions 2 and 4. Using the mask `0x55555555` and shifting left by 1 gives us `10010`.

Combining the two results using `|` gives `11010`, which is `26` in decimal.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), since the operations are constant time bit manipulations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the space required is fixed, only involving a few bitwise operations.

This solution efficiently swaps odd and even bits in constant time by using simple bitwise operations and leveraging bit masks.
