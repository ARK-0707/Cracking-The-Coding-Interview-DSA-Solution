# 5.8 Draw Line

## Problem Description
A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width `w`, where `w` is divisible by `8` (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from `(x1, y)` to `(x2, y)`. The method signature should look something like: `drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)`

### Approach
1. **Determine byte boundaries**: 
   - Compute the byte in which `x1` starts (`first_full_byte`) and the byte in which `x2` ends (`last_full_byte`).
   - Handle partial bytes at the beginning and end if `x1` or `x2` are not aligned to byte boundaries.
   
2. **Set full bytes**: 
   - Set all full bytes between `x1` and `x2` to `0xFF` (i.e., all bits set to 1) since they represent the pixels entirely covered by the line.

3. **Handle start and end masks**: 
   - For the byte containing `x1`, use a mask to ensure only the appropriate bits are set.
   - Similarly, for the byte containing `x2`, create a mask to ensure only the relevant bits are set.

### Example Usage
```python
def drawLine(screen, width, x1, x2, y):
    # Calculate the start and end byte positions
    start_offset = x1 % 8
    first_full_byte = x1 // 8
    if start_offset != 0:
        first_full_byte += 1

    end_offset = x2 % 8
    last_full_byte = x2 // 8
    if end_offset != 7:
        last_full_byte -= 1

    # Set all full bytes to 0xFF
    for b in range(first_full_byte, last_full_byte + 1):
        screen[(width // 8) * y + b] = 0xFF

    # Create the start and end masks
    start_mask = (0xFF >> start_offset)
    end_mask = ~(0xFF >> (end_offset + 1))

    # Handle case where x1 and x2 are in the same byte
    if (x1 // 8) == (x2 // 8):
        byte_mask = start_mask & end_mask
        screen[(width // 8) * y + (x1 // 8)] |= byte_mask
    else:
        # Set the start byte
        if start_offset != 0:
            byte_number = (width // 8) * y + (x1 // 8)
            screen[byte_number] |= start_mask
        # Set the end byte
        if end_offset != 7:
            byte_number = (width // 8) * y + (x2 // 8)
            screen[byte_number] |= end_mask

# Example usage
width = 16  # Width of the screen in bits
screen = [0b00000000, 0b00000000, 0b00000000, 0b00000000]  # Initial empty screen
drawLine(screen, width, 3, 10, 0)  # Draw a horizontal line from x1=3 to x2=10 on row y=0

# Print the screen after drawing the line
for byte in screen:
    print(f"{byte:08b}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: First, we calculate the starting and ending byte positions.
    - `x1` and `x2` are the pixel coordinates, and we compute their respective byte locations.
    - The start offset is the bit within the byte where `x1` falls, and similarly for `x2`.

- **Step 2**: We handle the case where `x1` and `x2` are not aligned to byte boundaries by creating masks:
    - `start_mask`: Ensures only the bits starting from `x1` are set to 1.
    - `end_mask`: Ensures only the bits up to `x2` are set to 1.
    - These masks are applied to the corresponding bytes.

- **Step 3**: If `x1` and `x2` fall in different bytes, we:
    - Set all intermediate bytes to `0xFF`.
    - Apply the start mask to the first byte and the end mask to the last byte.

### Example Walkthrough:
Given a width of 16 bits (or 2 bytes per row), and a screen of 4 bytes (2 rows):
- Initial screen:
    ```
    00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
    ```
- Drawing a line from `x1 = 3` to `x2 = 10` on row `y = 0`, the screen updates to:
    ```
    00011111 11000000 00000000 00000000
    ```

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of bytes between `x1` and `x2`. Since this is proportional to the number of bytes to update, it is efficient.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use only a few extra variables to store bit masks.

This solution efficiently draws a horizontal line on a monochrome screen using bit manipulation techniques.
