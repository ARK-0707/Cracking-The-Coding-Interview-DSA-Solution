# 5.5 Debugger

### Problem: Explain what the following code does: `((n & (n - 1)) == 0)`

#### **Purpose:**
This line of code checks if a given number `n` is a power of two.

#### **How it works:**

- `n & (n - 1)` is a common bit manipulation technique used to test whether `n` is a power of two.
  
- **For a number that is a power of two:**
  - A power of two in binary has exactly one bit set to `1` and all other bits are `0`. 
    - For example:
      - `4` in binary is `100`.
      - `8` in binary is `1000`.
  - When you subtract `1` from a power of two, the result flips all the bits after the first `1` from the right. 
    - For example:
      - `4 - 1` is `011`.
      - `8 - 1` is `0111`.
  - The result of `n & (n - 1)` for a power of two will be `0` because no bits are shared between the number and its predecessor.
    - For example:
      - `4 & 3 = 100 & 011 = 000`.
      - `8 & 7 = 1000 & 0111 = 0000`.

- **For a number that is not a power of two:**
  - The expression `n & (n - 1)` will not result in `0` because there will be overlapping `1` bits in the binary representation of `n` and `n - 1`.

- Therefore, the expression checks if `n` is a power of two by testing whether `n & (n - 1)` is equal to `0`.

#### **Code:**

```python
def debugger(n):
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0


# Example usage
print(debugger(4))  # Output: True, since 4 is 2^2 and a power of two
print(debugger(5))  # Output: False, since 5 is not a power of two
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **`debugger(4)`**: 
  - `4` in binary is `100`.
  - `4 - 1` is `3` in binary, which is `011`.
  - `4 & 3` results in `000`, which is `0`.
  - Therefore, the result is `True`, meaning `4` is a power of two.
  
- **`debugger(5)`**: 
  - `5` in binary is `101`.
  - `5 - 1` is `4` in binary, which is `100`.
  - `5 & 4` results in `100`, which is not `0`.
  - Therefore, the result is `False`, meaning `5` is not a power of two.

#### **Edge Case:**
- `n = 0` will return `True` because `0 & (-1)` is `0`, but this is an edge case where `0` isn't typically considered a power of two. If needed, you could add a condition to handle `n == 0` separately.

### Example Output:
```python
True   # 4 is a power of two
False  # 5 is not a power of two
```
