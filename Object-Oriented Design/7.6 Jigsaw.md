# 7.6 Jigsaw

## Problem Description
Implement an NxN jigsaw puzzle. Design the data structures and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle. You can assume that you have a `fitsWith()` 
method which, when passed two puzzle edges, returns true if the two puzzle edges belong together.

### Data Structures

1. **JigsawPiece**:
    - Each piece has a name (generated randomly) and positional attributes for its edges (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`).
    - The position (row and column) of the piece is stored for reference.
    
2. **JigsawPuzzle**:
    - The main puzzle contains a `N x N` grid, generated randomly with `JigsawPiece` objects. 
    - The system uses the `fitsWith()` method to check if two pieces match on their edges.
    - The solution involves placing the pieces in a manner where every piece is properly fitted with its neighbors.

### Code Implementation

```python
import random


class JigsawPiece:
    def __init__(self, row, col):
        self._position = {'row': row, 'col': col}  # Store row, col position for reference
        self.name = ''.join(random.choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') for _ in range(7))  # Random unique name for each piece
        self.up = None  # Neighboring piece reference for the top side
        self.down = None  # Neighboring piece reference for the bottom side
        self.left = None  # Neighboring piece reference for the left side
        self.right = None  # Neighboring piece reference for the right side

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"JigsawPiece(name={self.name}, position=({self._position['row']}, {self._position['col']}))"


class JigsawPuzzle:
    def __init__(self, N):

# TEST CASE

# Create a 2x2 puzzle
puzzle = JigsawPuzzle(2)
print(puzzle.jigsaw_graph)  # Output the initial shuffled puzzle pieces

# Check if the puzzle is solved (should be False initially)
print(puzzle.check_done())

# Fit the puzzle pieces
puzzle.fit_puzzle()

# Output the pieces after fitting
print(puzzle.jigsaw_graph)

# Check if the puzzle is now solved (should be True after fitting)
print(puzzle.check_done())
```

### Explanation of Key Functions

1. **JigsawPiece**:
    - The class represents individual pieces of the puzzle, with unique names and positions (row, col). It also stores references to neighboring pieces (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`).

2. **JigsawPuzzle**:
    - The class represents the entire puzzle and contains an NxN grid of pieces.
    - `gen_pieces(N)` generates `N*N` pieces and randomizes their order.
    - `match(piece1, piece2, direction)` checks if two pieces fit together based on their positions in the grid and the direction.
    - `check_piece(piece)` verifies if a piece is placed correctly by checking its neighboring pieces.
    - `check_done()` checks if all pieces in the puzzle are correctly placed.
    - `fit_puzzle()` iterates over all pieces and fits them together by setting the appropriate neighbor references (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`).

### Algorithm to Solve the Puzzle
1. **Generate Puzzle Pieces**: 
   Generate `N*N` puzzle pieces with random positions and shuffle them to simulate an unsolved puzzle.
   
2. **Match Puzzle Pieces**: 
   Use the `match()` method to compare each piece with its potential neighbors in all four directions. If they fit, link them by updating the corresponding edge (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`).

3. **Check Puzzle Completion**: 
   After the pieces are arranged, the `check_done()` method validates that all pieces are properly fitted by checking their neighbor relationships.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   Handle edge cases like pieces at the borders (first row, last row, first column, last column) where there should be no neighbors in certain directions.

### Test Output
- The initial random puzzle will be displayed.
- The `check_done()` method will initially return `False` since the puzzle is not fitted.
- After calling `fit_puzzle()`, the puzzle is fitted correctly.
- The final call to `check_done()` will return `True`, indicating that the puzzle is solved.

This approach solves the jigsaw puzzle using a straightforward matching process, efficiently fitting the pieces together based on their neighbors.
