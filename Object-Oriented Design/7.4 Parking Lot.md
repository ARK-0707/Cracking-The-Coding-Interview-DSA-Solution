# 7.4 Parking Lot

## Problem Description
Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.

### Code Implementation

```python
# Class representing the parking lot
class ParkingLot:
    def __init__(self, spaces):
        self.limit = spaces  # Total number of parking spaces in the lot
        self.number = 0  # Count of cars currently parked
        self.cars = {}  # Dictionary to store car objects (key: car name, value: car object)

    def park(self, car):
        """Parks the car if there is available space and the car isn't already parked."""
        if self.number < self.limit:  # Check if there is available space
            if car.name in self.cars:  # Check if the car is already parked
                print(f'The car "{car.name}" is already inside the parking lot.')
            else:
                self.cars[car.name] = car  # Add car to the dictionary
                self.number += 1  # Increase the count of parked cars
                print(f'Car "{car.name}" parked.')
        else:
            print('The parking lot is full!')

    def exit(self, car):
        """Removes the car from the parking lot if it is parked inside."""
        if self.number == 0:
            print('There are no cars in the parking lot.')
        elif car.name not in self.cars:  # Check if the car is in the lot
            print(f'The car "{car.name}" is not in the parking lot.')
        else:
            del self.cars[car.name]  # Remove the car from the dictionary
            self.number -= 1  # Decrease the count of parked cars
            print(f'Car "{car.name}" exited.')

    def available(self):
        """Returns True if there is available space in the parking lot."""
        return self.number < self.limit


# Class representing a car
class Car:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Name of the car (can be a unique identifier)


# TESTING

# Create a parking lot with 2 spaces
parking_lot = ParkingLot(2)

# Create some cars
car1 = Car("Car 1")
car2 = Car("Car 2")
car3 = Car("Car 3")

# Park the cars
parking_lot.park(car1)  # Should park successfully
parking_lot.park(car2)  # Should park successfully
parking_lot.park(car3)  # Should print "The parking lot is full!"

# Try parking a car that is already parked
parking_lot.park(car1)  # Should print "The car is already inside the parking lot"

# Check availability
print("Parking available:", parking_lot.available())  # Should return False (lot is full)

# Exit a car
parking_lot.exit(car1)  # Should remove Car 1

# Check availability after exit
print("Parking available:", parking_lot.available())  # Should return True (one space is free)

# Try exiting a car that's not in the lot
parking_lot.exit(car1)  # Should print "The car is not in the parking lot"
```

### Explanation

#### `ParkingLot` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `limit`: The total number of spaces available in the parking lot.
  - `number`: The number of cars currently parked.
  - `cars`: A dictionary to store car objects (using car name as the key).
- **Methods**:
  - `park(car)`: Parks the car if space is available and the car is not already parked.
  - `exit(car)`: Removes the car from the lot if it is parked inside.
  - `available()`: Returns `True` if there are parking spaces available.

#### `Car` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: The name of the car (can be used as a unique identifier for each car).

#### Features Implemented
1. **Park cars**: Cars can be parked in the parking lot if space is available.
2. **Exit cars**: Cars can exit the parking lot, freeing up space.
3. **Check availability**: You can check if there are available parking spaces.
4. **Prevent double parking**: A car cannot be parked again if it is already parked.
5. **Full lot handling**: If the parking lot is full, additional cars cannot be parked.

### Conclusion
This design implements a parking lot system using object-oriented principles. The system allows parking, exiting, and checking available spaces while handling edge cases like full lots and duplicate parking attempts. The design can be extended further by adding features like parking fees, different vehicle types, or multi-level parking.
