# 7.2 Call Center

## Problem Description
Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be allocated to a 
respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not 
able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes, and data structures for this problem. Implement a method 
`dispatchCall()` which assigns a call to the first available employee.

### Code Implementation

```python
from collections import deque

# Class representing an incoming call
class Call:
    def __init__(self, caller):
        self.caller = caller
        self.rank = 0  # Start with 0 (respondent level)

    def increment_rank(self):
        """Promotes the call to the next level (manager or director)."""
        self.rank += 1

    def get_rank(self):
        """Gets the current rank of the call (respondent: 0, manager: 1, director: 2)."""
        return self.rank

# Base Employee class
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.free = True

    def is_free(self):
        """Check if the employee is free."""
        return self.free

    def take_call(self, call):
        """Assign a call to the employee."""
        self.free = False
        print(f"{self.name} is handling the call from {call.caller}.")

    def end_call(self):
        """Mark the employee as free after handling the call."""
        self.free = True

# Respondent, Manager, and Director inherit from Employee
class Respondent(Employee):
    pass

class Manager(Employee):
    pass

class Director(Employee):
    pass

# CallCenter class that manages the employees and dispatching of calls
class CallCenter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.respondents = deque()
        self.managers = deque()
        self.directors = deque()

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        """Add employees to the call center."""
        if isinstance(employee, Respondent):
            self.respondents.append(employee)
        elif isinstance(employee, Manager):
            self.managers.append(employee)
        elif isinstance(employee, Director):
            self.directors.append(employee)

    def dispatchCall(self, call):
        """Dispatches a call to the first available employee at the current or escalated level."""
        # Try to assign to a respondent
        if call.get_rank() == 0:
            if self.respondents and self.respondents[0].is_free():
                respondent = self.respondents.popleft()
                respondent.take_call(call)
                self.respondents.append(respondent)
                return True
            else:
                print("No respondents available. Escalating the call.")
                call.increment_rank()

        # Try to assign to a manager
        if call.get_rank() == 1:
            if self.managers and self.managers[0].is_free():
                manager = self.managers.popleft()
                manager.take_call(call)
                self.managers.append(manager)
                return True
            else:
                print("No managers available. Escalating the call.")
                call.increment_rank()

        # Try to assign to a director
        if call.get_rank() == 2:
            if self.directors and self.directors[0].is_free():
                director = self.directors.popleft()
                director.take_call(call)
                self.directors.append(director)
                return True
            else:
                print("No directors available. Call is waiting.")
                return False

        return False  # No one available

# Example usage of the system
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize a call center
    call_center = CallCenter()

    # Add employees (respondents, managers, and directors)
    call_center.add_employee(Respondent("Respondent 1"))
    call_center.add_employee(Respondent("Respondent 2"))
    call_center.add_employee(Manager("Manager 1"))
    call_center.add_employee(Director("Director 1"))

    # Simulate incoming calls
    num_of_calls = int(input("Enter the number of incoming calls: "))
    for i in range(num_of_calls):
        call = Call(f"Caller {i + 1}")
        if not call_center.dispatchCall(call):
            print(f"Caller {i + 1} is on hold due to no available employees.")
```

### Explanation

#### `Call` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `caller`: Represents the caller's identity.
  - `rank`: Represents the level of the call. Starts at 0 (respondent level), and escalates to 1 (manager) and 2 (director) as needed.
- **Methods**:
  - `increment_rank()`: Increases the call's rank to the next level.
  - `get_rank()`: Retrieves the current rank of the call.

#### `Employee` Base Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: Employee's name.
  - `free`: A boolean indicating whether the employee is available to take a call.
- **Methods**:
  - `is_free()`: Checks if the employee is free.
  - `take_call()`: Assigns a call to the employee and marks them as busy.
  - `end_call()`: Marks the employee as free after handling the call.

#### `Respondent`, `Manager`, and `Director` Classes
- These classes inherit from `Employee` and behave similarly. They only differ in their rank (which is handled in the call center's logic).

#### `CallCenter` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `respondents`, `managers`, `directors`: Queues to store employees at each level.
- **Methods**:
  - `add_employee(employee)`: Adds an employee to the appropriate queue (based on their type).
  - `dispatchCall(call)`: Tries to assign a call to the first available employee. If no one is available at the current level, the call is escalated to the next level.

#### Call Dispatching Logic:
1. **Respondent Level**:
   - If a respondent is free, the call is assigned to them.
   - If no respondent is free, the call is escalated to the manager level.
   
2. **Manager Level**:
   - If a manager is free, the call is assigned to them.
   - If no manager is free, the call is escalated to the director level.

3. **Director Level**:
   - If a director is free, the call is assigned to them.
   - If no director is free, the call is put on hold.

### Conclusion
This design handles call dispatching in a call center with three levels of employees. Calls are allocated to available employees, and if no one is available at a given level, the system escalates the call to the next level.
