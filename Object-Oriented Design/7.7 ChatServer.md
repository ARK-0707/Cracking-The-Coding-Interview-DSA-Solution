# 7.7 Chat Server 

## Problem Description
Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details about the various backend components, classes, and methods. 
What would be the hardest problem to solve?

## Approach
To implement the chat server, we’ll create two main components:
1. **Server**: The backend server responsible for managing connections, broadcasting messages, and handling private messages.
2. **Client**: A simple client that connects to the server and sends/receives messages.

We'll walk through the design, backend components, and the algorithm used to manage client communication.

### Server Component (Backend)
The server will use **sockets** for communication and **threads** to handle multiple clients concurrently. Here’s a breakdown of the key parts:

### Classes and Methods:
#### 1. **ChatServer Class**
   - **Attributes**:
     - `server_socket`: The main server socket for accepting connections.
     - `clients`: A list to keep track of all connected clients.
     - `usernames`: A dictionary mapping usernames to their corresponding client sockets.
   - **Methods**:
     - `__init__(self, host, port)`: Initializes the server socket and binds it to the specified host and port.
     - `broadcast(self, message, client_socket)`: Sends a message to all clients except the sender.
     - `private_message(self, message, username)`: Sends a private message to a specific user.
     - `remove_client(self, client_socket)`: Removes a client from the server when they disconnect.
     - `handle_client(self, client_socket, address)`: Handles communication with a connected client, including broadcasting and handling private messages.
     - `parse_private_message(self, message)`: Parses a private message to extract the target username and message content.
     - `start(self)`: Starts the server and listens for incoming client connections.

#### 2. **Client Component**
   - The client will connect to the server and allow the user to send and receive messages.
   - It will handle the following tasks:
     - Sending messages to the server.
     - Receiving and printing messages from the server.

### Example Usage

#### Server Code (Server.py)
```python
import socket
import threading

# Constants
HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 12345

clients = []
usernames = {}


class ChatServer:
    def __init__(self, host, port):
        self.server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        self.server_socket.bind((host, port))
        self.server_socket.listen(5)
        print(f"Server started on {host}:{port}")

    def broadcast(self, message, client_socket):
        """Broadcast messages to all clients except the sender"""
        for client in clients:
            if client != client_socket:
                try:
                    client.send((message + '\n').encode())
                except:
                    self.remove_client(client)

    def private_message(self, message, username):
        """Send a private message to a specific user"""
        if username in usernames:
            client_socket = usernames[username]
            try:
                client_socket.send((message + '\n').encode())
            except:
                self.remove_client(client_socket)
        else:
            print(f"User {username} not found.")

    def remove_client(self, client_socket):
        """Remove the client from the list when connection is lost"""
        if client_socket in clients:
            clients.remove(client_socket)
            for name, client in usernames.items():
                if client == client_socket:
                    del usernames[name]
                    break

    def handle_client(self, client_socket, address):
        """Handle communication with a connected client"""
        print(f"New connection from {address}")
        client_socket.send("Username: ".encode())
        username = client_socket.recv(1024).decode().strip()

        usernames[username] = client_socket
        welcome_message = f"{username} joined the chat!"
        self.broadcast(welcome_message, client_socket)

        while True:
            try:
                message = client_socket.recv(1024).decode().strip()
                if message:
                    if message.startswith('@'):
                        target_username, msg = self.parse_private_message(message)
                        if target_username and msg:
                            self.private_message(f"[PRIVATE] {username}: {msg}", target_username)

                break

    def parse_private_message(self, message):
        """Parse and return the target username and private message"""
        if message.startswith('@'):
            parts = message.split(' ', 1)
            if len(parts) > 1:
                target_username = parts[0][1:]
                msg = parts[1]
                return target_username, msg
        return None, None

    def start(self):
        """Start the server and listen for incoming connections"""
        while True:
            client_socket, address = self.server_socket.accept()
            clients.append(client_socket)
            client_handler = threading.Thread(target=self.handle_client, args=(client_socket, address))
            client_handler.start()


# Start the server

    client_socket.connect(('127.0.0.1', 12345))

    username = input("Enter your username: ")
    client_socket.send((username + '\n').encode())

    threading.Thread(target=receive_messages, args=(client_socket,)).start()
    threading.Thread(target=send_messages, args=(client_socket,)).start()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_client()
```

### Explanation

#### 1. **Client-Server Architecture**
   - **Client**: Each client connects to the server and communicates by sending messages. It also receives messages from the server, which are either public (broadcast) or private.
   - **Server**: The server listens for new client connections. Each client is handled in a separate thread so multiple clients can interact simultaneously.

#### 2. **Socket Programming**
   - **Sockets** are used for communication between the client and server. Each client has a socket connection to the server.
   - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is used for reliable message delivery.

#### 3. **Multithreading**
   - The server creates a new thread for each client connection, allowing it to handle multiple clients concurrently.
   - This ensures that the server doesn’t block while waiting for a single client and can serve all connected clients simultaneously.

#### 4. **Message Handling**
   - **Broadcast**: A message is sent to all clients connected to the server except the sender.
   - **Private Message**: Clients can send private messages to specific users by typing `@username message`.
   - **Disconnection**: When a client disconnects or the connection is lost, the server removes the client and their username from the list of active users.

### Challenges
- **Handling Client Disconnections**: One of the hardest problems to solve is managing unexpected client disconnections. The server needs to detect and handle when a client disconnects, ensuring that resources are freed, and no broken sockets are left open.
  
- **Concurrency Management**: Handling multiple client connections at the same time without conflicts requires careful management of shared resources (like the list of clients). Multithreading introduces the challenge of ensuring thread safety when modifying shared data structures.

- **Scalability**: As the number of clients increases, the server must efficiently manage each connection to prevent performance bottlenecks. In a larger-scale deployment, more advanced techniques like event-driven architectures (e.g., `select`, `poll`, or asynchronous IO) or load balancing may be required to handle high traffic.
