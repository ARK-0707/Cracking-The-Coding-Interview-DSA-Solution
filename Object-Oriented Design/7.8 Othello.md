## 7.8 Othello

### Problem Description
Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other. When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both 
the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped. On your turn, you must capture at least 
one of your opponent's pieces. The game ends when either user has no more valid moves. The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. 
Implement the object-oriented design for Othello.

### Approach

1. **`OthelloPiece` class**: Represents a game piece that can be either black or white. It includes a method to flip the piece when captured by the opponent.

2. **`OthelloBoard` class**: Represents the 8x8 board and contains methods to manage the game's state, such as initializing the board, placing pieces, and flipping captured pieces. It also checks if moves are valid and handles the rules of capturing.

3. **`Player` class**: Represents a player with a color ('B' or 'W').

4. **`OthelloGame` class**: Manages the overall game flow, including alternating turns between players, checking for valid moves, and determining the winner when the game ends.

### Explanation

#### 1. **OthelloPiece**
   - Represents an individual piece on the board, either black ('B') or white ('W').
   - It includes a method `flip()` to change the piece from black to white or vice versa.

#### 2. **OthelloBoard**
   - The board is an 8x8 grid, initialized with two black and two white pieces at the center.
   - `is_valid_move(row, col, color)` checks if a given move is valid by ensuring the piece flips one or more opponent pieces.
   - `place_piece(row, col, color)` places the piece at the specified location and flips opponent pieces.
   - The directions in `DIRECTIONS` represent the 8 possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) where pieces can be flipped.
   - `has_valid_moves(color)` checks if a player has any valid moves left.
   - `count_pieces()` counts the number of black and white pieces on the board.

#### 3. **Player**
   - Represents a player and their color ('B' or 'W').

#### 4. **OthelloGame**
   - Controls the game loop, alternating between players.
   - `play()` manages the game flow, handling moves, checking for valid moves, and determining the gameâ€™s winner.
   - `get_player_move()` prompts the player to input their move.

#### 5. **Game Flow**
   - The game begins with an initialized board containing two black and two white pieces placed in the center.
   - The players take turns placing their pieces, with Player 'B' (Black) starting the game.
   - Each move must capture at least one of the opponent's pieces by sandwiching them between the placed piece and an existing piece of the same color, flipping them to the current player's color.
   - If a player has no valid moves, their turn is skipped, and the opponent continues playing.
   - The game ends when no player has a valid move remaining, after which the pieces are counted, and the player with the most pieces wins.
   - In case of an equal number of pieces, the game results in a tie.

#### 6. **Handling Invalid Moves**
   - The method `is_valid_move()` checks for each potential move if it follows the game rules, i.e., if it results in at least one piece being flipped. If no pieces are flipped, the move is considered invalid.
   - If a player attempts an invalid move, the game will prompt them to try again until a valid move is entered.

#### 7. **End Game Condition**
   - The game loop terminates when neither player has any valid moves left. This is determined by calling `has_valid_moves()` for each player.
   - Once the game ends, the board's current state is displayed, and the `count_pieces()` method is used to determine how many black and white pieces are on the board.
   - The winner is the player with more pieces, or the game ends in a tie if both players have an equal number of pieces.

### Potential Extensions
- **AI Implementation**: A basic AI player can be added by generating possible moves for the computer and evaluating the best one.
- **GUI Support**: The game could be extended with a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow easier interaction and visualization.
- **Variable Board Sizes**: While the standard Othello board is 8x8, the design could be adapted for variable board sizes.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Adding a feature to undo or redo moves could be useful for players to explore different strategies.
- **Multiplayer Online Support**: An online version could allow remote players to compete against each other.

### Conclusion
This implementation of Othello covers the main components of the game and handles piece placement, move validation, piece flipping, and game state management. The code is structured in an object-oriented manner, allowing for easy extensions and modifications to enhance gameplay.
