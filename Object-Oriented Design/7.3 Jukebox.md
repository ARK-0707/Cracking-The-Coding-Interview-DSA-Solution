# Jukebox

## Problem Overview
Design a musical jukebox using object-oriented principles.

### Code Implementation

```python
import random


# Class representing the jukebox player
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.song_queue = []  # List to store the songs in the queue
        self.current_song = None  # The currently playing song

    def shuffle(self):
        """Shuffle the songs in the queue."""
        if self.song_queue:
            random.shuffle(self.song_queue)
            print("Song queue shuffled.")
        else:
            print("No songs in the queue to shuffle.")

    def play(self):
        """Play the current song or the next song if nothing is playing."""
        if self.current_song is None:  # If no song is currently playing
            if self.song_queue:  # Check if there are songs in the queue
                self.current_song = self.song_queue.pop(0)  # Take the first song from the queue
                print(f"Playing song: {self.current_song.name}")
                self.current_song.play()  # Call the play method on the Song object
            else:
                print("No songs in the queue to play.")
        else:
            print(f'Song "{self.current_song.name}" is already playing.')

    def pause(self):
        """Pause the currently playing song."""
        if self.current_song is not None:
            print(f"Pausing song: {self.current_song.name}")
            self.current_song.pause()  # Call the pause method on the Song object
        else:
            print('No song is currently playing.')

    def next_song(self):
        """Skip to the next song in the queue."""
        if self.song_queue:  # If there are more songs in the queue
            print(f"Skipping to the next song.")
            self.current_song = self.song_queue.pop(0)  # Take the next song from the queue
            print(f"Playing song: {self.current_song.name}")
            self.current_song.play()
        else:
            print("No more songs in the queue.")

    def add_song(self, song):
        """Add a new song to the queue."""
        self.song_queue.append(song)  # Add a song object to the queue
        print(f'Added song: "{song.name}" to the queue.')

    def show_queue(self):
        """Display the songs in the queue."""
        if self.song_queue:
            print("Current song queue:")
            for i, song in enumerate(self.song_queue, 1):
                print(f"{i}. {song.name}")
        else:
            print("The song queue is empty.")

    def current_song_name(self):
        """Return the name of the currently playing song."""
        if self.current_song:
            return f"Currently playing: {self.current_song.name}"
        else:
            return "No song is currently playing."


# Class representing a song
class Song:
    def __init__(self, name, track_file):
        self.name = name  # The name of the song
        self.track = track_file  # Placeholder for audio handling (e.g., mp3 file)

    def play(self):
        """Simulate playing the song."""
        print(f'Playing track: "{self.name}"')

    def pause(self):
        """Simulate pausing the song."""
        print(f'Pausing track: "{self.name}"')


# Testing the Jukebox System

# Create a player
jukebox = Player()

# Create some songs
song1 = Song("Song 1", "track1.mp3")
song2 = Song("Song 2", "track2.mp3")
song3 = Song("Song 3", "track3.mp3")

# Add songs to the jukebox
jukebox.add_song(song1)
jukebox.add_song(song2)
jukebox.add_song(song3)

# Show the current queue
jukebox.show_queue()

# Shuffle the songs in the queue
jukebox.shuffle()

# Show the queue after shuffling
jukebox.show_queue()

# Play the first song in the queue
jukebox.play()

# Pause the current song
jukebox.pause()

# Skip to the next song
jukebox.next_song()

# Play the current song (if no song is playing)
jukebox.play()

# Show the name of the currently playing song
print(jukebox.current_song_name())
```

### Explanation

#### `Player` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `song_queue`: A list to store the queue of songs.
  - `current_song`: Holds the song object that is currently playing (initially `None`).
- **Methods**:
  - `shuffle()`: Shuffles the songs in the queue randomly.
  - `play()`: Plays the current song or, if no song is playing, takes the first song from the queue and plays it.
  - `pause()`: Pauses the currently playing song.
  - `next_song()`: Skips to the next song in the queue and plays it.
  - `add_song(song)`: Adds a song object to the queue.
  - `show_queue()`: Displays the list of songs in the queue.
  - `current_song_name()`: Returns the name of the song that is currently playing.

#### `Song` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `name`: The name of the song.
  - `track`: A placeholder for the song's file (e.g., mp3 file).
- **Methods**:
  - `play()`: Simulates playing the song.
  - `pause()`: Simulates pausing the song.

#### Features Implemented
1. **Add songs to queue**: You can add new songs to the jukebox queue.
2. **Play song**: Plays the first song in the queue.
3. **Pause song**: Pauses the currently playing song.
4. **Next song**: Skips to the next song and plays it.
5. **Shuffle queue**: Randomly shuffles the order of songs in the queue.
6. **Display queue**: Shows the list of songs in the queue.
7. **Display currently playing song**: Shows the name of the song currently playing.

### Conclusion
This design implements a basic jukebox using object-oriented principles. It allows for song management, such as playing, pausing, skipping, and shuffling 
songs in the queue. The system could be expanded further by adding features like volume control, playlist creation, or handling audio playback in a real system.
