# 7.1 Deck of Cards

## Problem Description
Design the data structures for generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structure to implement blackjack.

### Generic Deck of Cards:
- A card is defined by two properties: a **suit** and a **rank**.
- A **deck** contains a list of 52 cards, and operations include shuffling the deck and dealing a card.

### Blackjack-Specific Deck:
- In Blackjack, cards have specific values: numbered cards (2-10) hold their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and an Ace (A) can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on the situation.
- We subclass the generic deck to handle Blackjack's special card values and game logic.

### Code Implementation

```python
import random

# Define a generic Card class
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit, rank):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.rank} of {self.suit}"

# Define a generic Deck class
class Deck:
    suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']
    ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']

    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = [Card(suit, rank) for suit in self.suits for rank in self.ranks]
        self.shuffle()

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal(self):
        if not self.cards:
            raise ValueError("All cards have been dealt")
        return self.cards.pop()

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Deck of {len(self.cards)} cards"

# Define a BlackjackDeck subclass
class BlackjackDeck(Deck):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    # Assign card values based on Blackjack rules
    def card_value(self, card):
        if card.rank in ['J', 'Q', 'K']:
            return 10
        elif card.rank == 'A':
            return 11  # By default, treat Ace as 11
        else:
            return int(card.rank)

    # Calculate the total hand value, adjusting for Aces if necessary
    def hand_value(self, hand):
        value = sum(self.card_value(card) for card in hand)
        # Handle the flexibility of Aces
        aces = sum(1 for card in hand if card.rank == 'A')
        while value > 21 and aces:
            value -= 10
            aces -= 1
        return value

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Blackjack Deck with {len(self.cards)} cards"

# Function to print a hand and its value
def print_hand_and_value(name, hand, deck):
    hand_repr = ', '.join(str(card) for card in hand)
    hand_value = deck.hand_value(hand)
    print(f"{name}'s hand: {hand_repr} (Value: {hand_value})")

# Main game function for Blackjack
def main():
    # Initialize the Blackjack deck and deal initial hands
    deck = BlackjackDeck()
    player_hand = [deck.deal(), deck.deal()]
    dealer_hand = [deck.deal(), deck.deal()]

    print_hand_and_value("Player", player_hand, deck)
    print_hand_and_value("Dealer", [dealer_hand[0], "Hidden"], deck)

    # Player's turn
    while deck.hand_value(player_hand) < 21:
        action = input("Do you want to [H]it or [S]tand? ").strip().upper()
        if action == 'H':
            player_hand.append(deck.deal())
            print_hand_and_value("Player", player_hand, deck)
        elif action == 'S':
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter 'H' to hit or 'S' to stand.")

    player_value = deck.hand_value(player_hand)
    if player_value > 21:
        print("Player busts! Dealer wins.")
        return

    # Dealer's turn
    print_hand_and_value("Dealer", dealer_hand, deck)
    while deck.hand_value(dealer_hand) < 17:
        dealer_hand.append(deck.deal())
        print_hand_and_value("Dealer", dealer_hand, deck)

    # Compare final hands
    dealer_value = deck.hand_value(dealer_hand)
    if dealer_value > 21:
        print("Dealer busts! Player wins.")
    elif dealer_value > player_value:
        print("Dealer wins.")
    elif dealer_value < player_value:
        print("Player wins.")
    else:
        print("It's a tie.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

#### Generic Card and Deck Classes:
1. **Card Class**:
   - Each card is represented by its `suit` and `rank`.
   - Example: "Ace of Spades" or "7 of Diamonds".

2. **Deck Class**:
   - The `Deck` class creates a deck of 52 cards (combining all suits and ranks).
   - It provides methods to shuffle the deck and deal cards.
   - The `deal()` method removes and returns a card from the deck.

#### BlackjackDeck Subclass:
1. **Card Values**:
   - The `card_value()` method assigns values based on Blackjack rules:
     - 2-10 retain their values.
     - J, Q, K are worth 10.
     - Aces are initially considered 11 but can adjust to 1 if needed to avoid busting.

2. **Hand Value Calculation**:
   - The `hand_value()` method sums the values of the cards in a hand.
   - It adjusts the value of Aces dynamically: if the hand's value exceeds 21 and contains an Ace, the Ace is treated as 1 (instead of 11) until the hand value is 21 or lower.

#### Blackjack Game Flow:
- **Player's Turn**: The player can choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (end their turn).
- **Dealer's Turn**: The dealer automatically hits until their hand value is at least 17.
- **Result**: After both the player and dealer have completed their turns, the final values are compared to determine the winner.

### Conclusion
This design demonstrates how a generic deck of cards can be subclassed to implement a specific card game (Blackjack). The flexibility in defining card values and calculating hand totals makes it adaptable for other card games as well.
