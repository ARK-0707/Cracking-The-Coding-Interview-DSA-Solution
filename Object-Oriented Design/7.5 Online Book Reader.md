# TEST CASES

# Initialize the system
reader_system = OnlineReaderSystem()

# Create some books
book1 = Book(1, "The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald")
book2 = Book(2, "To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee")
book3 = Book(3, "1984", "George Orwell")

# Add books to the system
reader_system.add_book(book1)
reader_system.add_book(book2)
reader_system.add_book(book3)

# Create some users
user1 = User(101, "Alice")
user2 = User(102, "Bob")

# Add users to the system
reader_system.add_user(user1)
reader_system.add_user(user2)

# Activate Alice's membership
user1.create_membership()

# Set Alice as the active user
reader_system.set_active_user(user1)

# Alice searches for books
reader_system.search_books("Great")

# Alice reads a book
reader_system.read_book(1)

# Alice tries to read another book without closing the current one
reader_system.read_book(2)

# Alice closes the current book
reader_system.close_book()

# Alice reads another book
reader_system.read_book(2)

# Alice logs out
reader_system.remove_active_user()

# Set Bob as the active user

# Bob tries to read a book without an active membership

### Explanation

#### `User` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `user_id`: A unique identifier for the user.
  - `name`: The name of the user.
  - `membership_active`: Boolean representing whether the user has an active membership.
  - `active_book`: Keeps track of the book the user is currently reading.
- **Methods**:
  - `create_membership()`: Activates the user's membership.
  - `extend_membership()`: Extends the user's membership.
  - `read_book(book)`: Allows the user to read a book if membership is active and no other book is open.
  - `close_book()`: Closes the currently open book.

#### `Book` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `book_id`: A unique identifier for each book.
  - `title`: The book's title.
  - `author`: The book's author.
- **Methods**:
  - `__str__()`: Returns a string representation of the book.

#### `OnlineReaderSystem` Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `books`: Dictionary of all books in the system.
  - `users`: Dictionary of all users in the system.
  - `active_user`: The currently active user.
- **Methods**:
  - `add_book(book)`: Adds a book to the system.
  - `add_user(user)`: Adds a user to the system.
  - `search_books(keyword)`: Searches books by title or author.
  - `set_active_user(user)`: Sets a user as the active user.
  - `remove_active_user()`: Logs out the current active user.
  - `read_book(book_id)`: Allows the active user to read a book.
  - `close_book()`: Allows the active user to close the currently open book.

### Features
1. **Membership Handling**: Users can create and extend their membership.
2. **Search Books**: Users can search for books by title or author.
3. **Active User Management**: Only one user can be active at a time.
4. **Reading and Closing Books**: Users can read and close books, but cannot open a new book without closing the previous one.
5. **Error Handling**: The system handles errors like trying to read without an active membership or multiple active books.

### Conclusion
This object-oriented design implements an online reader system that allows users to read books while managing their membership and active status. 
The system is flexible and can be extended with additional features such as tracking reading history or handling multiple device logins.
