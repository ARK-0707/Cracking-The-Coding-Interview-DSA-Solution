# 7.10 Minesweeper

## Problem Description
Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game. Minesweeper is the classic single-player computer game where an `NxN` grid has `B mines` (or bombs) 
hidden across the grid. The remaining cells are either blank or have number behind them. The numbers reflect the number of bombs in the surrounding 
eight cells. The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a bomb, the player loses. If it is a number, the number is exposed. If it is a blank cell, this 
cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to and including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed. The player wins when all non-bomb cells are exposed. 
The player can also flag certain places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game play, other than to block the user from accidentally clicking a 
cell that is thought to have a bomb. (Tip for the reader: if you're not familiar with this game, please play a few rounds online first.)

### Approach
1. **Initialize the Game**: Set up the grid, place bombs, and compute the numbers indicating the count of adjacent bombs.
2. **Print the Board**: Display the current state of the game board to the player.
3. **Reveal Cells**: Uncover cells and propagate the reveal operation for adjacent cells if the uncovered cell is blank.
4. **Flag Cells**: Mark cells as suspected bombs.
5. **Check Win/Loss Conditions**: Determine if the game has been won or lost based on the current board state.

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**:
  - `__init__`: Initializes the game with a given board size and number of bombs. Calls `_place_bombs` to randomly place bombs and `_calculate_numbers` to set up the number hints for each cell.
  
- **Bomb Placement**:
  - `_place_bombs`: Randomly places bombs on the board using the `random.sample` function to ensure unique bomb positions.

- **Number Calculation**:
  - `_calculate_numbers`: Iterates over each cell to count the number of adjacent bombs and updates the cell with this count if it is not a bomb.

- **Printing the Board**:
  - `print_board`: Displays the current state of the game board to the player. Revealed cells and flags are shown, while hidden cells remain blank.

- **Revealing Cells**:
  - `reveal`: Reveals the cell at the specified position and propagates the reveal operation if the cell is blank. Ends the game if a bomb is hit or if all non-bomb cells are revealed.

- **Cell Reveal Propagation**:
  - `_reveal_cells`: Uses a queue-based breadth-first search to reveal all connected blank cells. Propagates to adjacent cells as needed.

- **Flagging Cells**:
  - `flag`: Marks cells with a flag to indicate suspected bombs. Allows toggling flags on and off.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Bomb Placement**: O(B), where B is the number of bombs.
  - **Number Calculation**: O($`N^2`$), where N is the board size.
  - **Reveal Operation**: O($`N^2`$) in the worst case when revealing all cells.
  - **Flag Operation**: O(1) for toggling flags.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - **Board Storage**: O($`N^2`$) for storing the board and display board.
  - **Queue Storage**: O($`N^2`$) in the worst case for the breadth-first search during reveal operations.

This implementation provides a complete text-based Minesweeper game with functionalities to play, reveal, flag, and determine win/loss conditions.
