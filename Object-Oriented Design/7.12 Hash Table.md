# 7.12 Hash Table

## Problem Description
Design and implement a hash table which uses chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions.

## Approach
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. To handle collisions (when multiple keys are mapped to the same index), 
we can use **chaining**. In chaining, each index of the hash table points to a linked list of entries. When a collision occurs, new elements are added 
to the linked list at that index.

### Data Structures and Functions

1. **Node**: Represents an entry in the hash table.
   - **Attributes**:
     - `key`: The key associated with this entry.
     - `value`: The value associated with the key.
     - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the linked list (for chaining).
   - **Methods**: None, this is a simple data holder.

2. **HashTable**: The hash table that manages entries.
   - **Attributes**:
     - `size`: The size of the table (i.e., number of buckets).
     - `table`: A list (array) of linked lists, where each index holds either `None` or a `Node`.
   - **Methods**:
     - `hash_function(key)`: Generates the index in the hash table by hashing the key.
     - `insert(key, value)`: Inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, the value is updated. Handles collisions using linked lists (chaining).
     - `search(key)`: Searches for a key in the hash table and returns its associated value. Returns `None` if the key is not found.
     - `delete(key)`: Deletes a key from the hash table. Returns `True` if the key is deleted, `False` if the key is not found.

### Example Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None


class HashTable:
    def __init__(self, size=10):
        self.size = size
        self.table = [None] * size  # Array of linked lists

    def hash_function(self, key):
        """Hash function to map the key to an index."""
        return hash(key) % self.size

    def insert(self, key, value):
        """Insert a key-value pair into the hash table."""
        index = self.hash_function(key)
        new_node = Node(key, value)

        if self.table[index] is None:
            # No collision, directly insert
            self.table[index] = new_node
        else:
            # Collision occurred, traverse the linked list
            current = self.table[index]
            while current is not None:
                if current.key == key:
                    # Key already exists, update value
                    current.value = value
                    return
                if current.next is None:
                    break
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node

    def search(self, key):
        """Search for a key in the hash table and return its value."""
        index = self.hash_function(key)
        current = self.table[index]

        while current is not None:
            if current.key == key:
                return current.value  # Key found
            current = current.next
        return None  # Key not found

    def delete(self, key):
        """Delete a key from the hash table."""
        index = self.hash_function(key)
        current = self.table[index]
        prev = None

        while current is not None:
            if current.key == key:
                if prev is None:
                    # Remove the head node of the linked list
                    self.table[index] = current.next
                else:
                    # Remove a middle or last node
                    prev.next = current.next
                return True  # Key deleted
            prev = current
            current = current.next
        return False  # Key not found


# Example Usage
hash_table = HashTable()

# Inserting values
hash_table.insert("apple", 5)
hash_table.insert("banana", 10)
hash_table.insert("orange", 8)

# Searching for values
print(hash_table.search("apple"))  # Output: 5
print(hash_table.search("banana"))  # Output: 10

# Deleting a key
hash_table.delete("orange")
print(hash_table.search("orange"))  # Output: None
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node Class**:
   - Each `Node` object holds a `key`, a `value`, and a `next` pointer that links to the next node in case of a collision.
   
2. **HashTable Class**:
   - **Initialization**: The hash table is created with a fixed size. The `table` attribute is a list of size `n` (10 by default), where each element is `None` or the head of a linked list.
   - **`hash_function`**: A simple function that computes the hash of a key and returns the index in the table by using the modulo operator (`hash(key) % size`).
   - **`insert`**: If no collision occurs (i.e., no node exists at the computed index), the node is inserted directly. If a collision occurs, the code traverses the linked list and either updates the value (if the key exists) or appends the new node to the end of the list.
   - **`search`**: The code traverses the linked list at the computed index to search for a specific key and returns the associated value.
   - **`delete`**: The method traverses the linked list at the index and removes the node with the matching key, adjusting pointers as necessary to maintain the list structure.

### Time Complexity:
- **Insertion**: O(1) in the best case (no collision), O(n) in the worst case (long linked list due to collisions).
- **Search**: O(1) in the best case, O(n) in the worst case.
- **Deletion**: O(1) in the best case, O(n) in the worst case.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements stored in the hash table.

This approach uses **chaining** to handle collisions efficiently, and the hash table can dynamically store and manage key-value pairs.
