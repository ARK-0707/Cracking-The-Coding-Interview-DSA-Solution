# 4.12 Paths with Sum

## Description
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (travelling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

### Implementation Details
To solve this problem, we use a depth-first search approach combined with a hashmap to track cumulative sums. The `cumulativeSumMap` helps efficiently check if the path sum that ends at the current node equals the target sum.

### Example Tree
            10
           /  \
          5   -3
         / \    \
        3   2   11
       / \   \
      3  -2   1


### Explanation
- **`countPathWithSum`**: This function initializes the cumulative sum map and calls the helper function `countPaths`.
- **`countPaths`**: This recursive function keeps track of the current sum of values along the path and uses the hashmap to find how many times the required sum (currentSum - targetSum) has occurred.
  - It updates the `cumulativeSumMap` to include the current path sum.
  - It recurses into the left and right subtrees.
  - After processing the node, it removes the current path sum from the `cumulativeSumMap` to backtrack properly.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack and the cumulative sum hashmap.

### Python Code
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def countPathWithSum(root, targetSum):
    def countPaths(node, currentSum, cumulativeSumMap):
        if not node:
            return 0

        currentSum += node.value
        sumToFind = currentSum - targetSum
        totalPaths = cumulativeSumMap.get(sumToFind, 0)

        cumulativeSumMap[currentSum] = cumulativeSumMap.get(currentSum, 0) + 1

        totalPaths += countPaths(node.left, currentSum, cumulativeSumMap)
        totalPaths += countPaths(node.right, currentSum, cumulativeSumMap)

        cumulativeSumMap[currentSum] -= 1

        return totalPaths

    cumulativeSumMap = {0: 1}
    return countPaths(root, 0, cumulativeSumMap)

# Example usage
root = TreeNode(10)
root.left = TreeNode(5)
root.right = TreeNode(-3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
root.right.right = TreeNode(11)
root.left.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left.right = TreeNode(-2)
root.left.right.right = TreeNode(1)

targetSum = 8
print(f"Number of paths with sum {targetSum}: {countPathWithSum(root, targetSum)}")
```

This implementation efficiently counts the number of paths that sum to a given value in a binary tree using depth-first search and a hashmap to track cumulative sums.
