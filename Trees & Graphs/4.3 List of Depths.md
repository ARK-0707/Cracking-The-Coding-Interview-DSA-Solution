# 4.3 List of Depths

## Description
Given a binary tree, Design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists.

### Implementation Details
The implementation uses two classes: `TreeNode` to represent nodes of the binary tree, and `ListNode` to represent nodes of the linked lists. 

Here's a breakdown of the methods and functions implemented:

- **`CreateLinkedList(root)`**: This function creates linked lists for each depth of the binary tree. It uses a breadth-first search approach to traverse the tree level by level.
- **`TreeNode` class**: Represents a node in the binary tree, containing a value, a left child, and a right child.
- **`ListNode` class**: Represents a node in a linked list, containing a value and a reference to the next node.

### Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = TreeNode(1, 
                    TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), 
                    TreeNode(3, TreeNode(6), TreeNode(7)))
    LinkedList = CreateLinkedList(root)

    for depth, llist in enumerate(LinkedList):
        print(f"Depth {depth}: ", end=" ")
        while llist:
            print(llist.value, end=" -> ")
            llist = llist.next
        print("None")
```

### Explanation
The `CreateLinkedList` function initializes a queue with the root of the tree and processes each level in a loop. For each level, it creates a linked list by iterating through all the nodes at that depth and linking them together. It then appends the linked list to the result list and continues to the next level. The queue ensures that nodes are processed in a breadth-first manner, maintaining the level order.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The space is used for the queue and the resulting linked lists.

### Python Code

```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def CreateLinkedList(root):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []
    currentLevel = deque([root])

    while currentLevel:
        level_length = len(currentLevel)
        head = ListNode(0)
        current = head

        for _ in range(level_length):
            node = currentLevel.popleft()
            current.next = ListNode(node.value)
            current = current.next

            if node.left:
                currentLevel.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                currentLevel.append(node.right)

        result.append(head.next)

    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3, TreeNode(6), TreeNode(7)))
    LinkedList = CreateLinkedList(root)

    for depth, llist in enumerate(LinkedList):
        print(f"Depth {depth}: ", end=" ")
        while llist:
            print(llist.value, end=" -> ")
            llist = llist.next
        print("None")
```

This implementation effectively creates linked lists for each level of a binary tree, ensuring that nodes at the same depth are grouped together in their respective linked lists.
