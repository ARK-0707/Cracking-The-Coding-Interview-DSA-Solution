# 4.8 First Common Ancestor

## Description
Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.

### Implementation Details
The algorithm utilizes a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and find the first common ancestor. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Base Case**: If the current root is `None`, return `None`.
2. **Check Current Root**: If the current root is one of the target nodes (`val1` or `val2`), return the root itself.
3. **Recursive Search**: Recursively search for the target nodes in the left and right subtrees.
4. **Determine Common Ancestor**:
   - If the target nodes are found in different subtrees (one in the left and one in the right), the current root is their common ancestor.
   - If both target nodes are found in the left subtree, return the result from the left subtree.
   - If both target nodes are found in the right subtree, return the result from the right subtree.

### Example Usage
```python
# Create the tree
#         1
#       /   \
#      2     3
#     / \     \
#    4   5     6
#       / \
#      7   8
```

### Explanation
This implementation leverages the recursive depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and determine the common ancestor. By checking the left and right subtrees, the algorithm efficiently identifies the node where the paths to `val1` and `val2` diverge, thus determining the first common ancestor.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, the algorithm needs to traverse all nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the space required by the recursion stack.

### Python Code
```python
# Example usage
# Create the tree
#         1
#       /   \
#      2     3
#     / \     \
#    4   5     6
#       / \
#      7   8

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def findCommonAncestor(root, val1, val2):
    # Base case: if root is None, return None
    if root is None:
        return None

    # If root is either val1 or val2, then root is the common ancestor
    if root.value == val1 or val2:
        return root

    # Recursively find val1 and val2 in the left and right subtrees
    left = findCommonAncestor(root.left, val1, val2)
    right = findCommonAncestor(root.right, val1, val2)

    # If val1 and val2 are found in different subtrees, root is their common ancestor
    if left is not None and right is not None:
        return root

    # If both nodes are found in the left subtree
    if left is not None:
        return left

    # If both nodes are found in the right subtree
    return right

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
root.right.right = TreeNode(6)
root.left.right.left = TreeNode(7)
root.left.right.right = TreeNode(8)

# Define nodes
p = 5  # Node 5
q = 6  # Node 6

# Find common ancestor
ancestor = findCommonAncestor(root, p, q)
print(f"The first common ancestor of nodes {p} and {q} is node {ancestor.value}")
```

This implementation correctly identifies the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree without additional data structures, providing an efficient and straightforward solution.
