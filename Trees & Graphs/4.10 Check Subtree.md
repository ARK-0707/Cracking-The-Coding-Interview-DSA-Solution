# 4.10 Check Subtree

## Description
T1 and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2. Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1. A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.

### Implementation Details
The algorithm to check if T2 is a subtree of T1 involves the following steps:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If T2 is `None`, then it is a subtree of T1 by definition.
   - If T1 is `None` and T2 is not `None`, then T2 cannot be a subtree of T1.
2. **Check Identical Subtree**:
   - Recursively check if the current nodes of T1 and T2 are identical.
   - If they are identical, return `True`.
3. **Recurse on Subtrees**:
   - Recursively check if T2 is a subtree of either the left or right subtree of T1.

### Example Usage
#### Tree T1:
             10
            /  \
           5    15
          / \   / \
         3   7 12  18
        /     / \
       1    11   13

#### Tree T2:
          15
         /  \
        12   18
        / \
       11  13


### Explanation
This implementation checks whether T2 is a subtree of T1 by leveraging two main functions: `isSubtree` and `areIdentical`. The `isSubtree` function handles the base cases and recursion, while the `areIdentical` function checks if two trees are identical.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of nodes in T1 and m is the number of nodes in T2. This is because in the worst case, we might need to compare each node of T1 with each node of T2.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the larger tree (T1). This is due to the recursion stack.

### Python Code
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSubtree(T1, T2):
    if T2 is None:
        return True
    if T1 is None:
        return False

    if areIdentical(T1, T2):
        return True

    return isSubtree(T1.left, T2) or isSubtree(T1.right, T2)

def areIdentical(root1, root2):
    if root1 is None and root2 is None:
        return True
    if root1 is None or root2 is None:
        return False

    return root1.value == root2.value and areIdentical(root1.left, root2.left) and areIdentical(root1.right, root2.right)

T1 = TreeNode(10, TreeNode(5, TreeNode(3, TreeNode(1), None), TreeNode(7)),
              TreeNode(15, TreeNode(12, TreeNode(11), TreeNode(13)), TreeNode(18)))
T2 = TreeNode(15, TreeNode(12, TreeNode(11), TreeNode(13)), TreeNode(18))

result = isSubtree(T1, T2)
if result:
    print("T2 is a subtree of T1")
else:
    print("T2 is not a subtree of T1")
```

This code correctly determines whether T2 is a subtree of T1, and it efficiently handles the base cases, recursion, and subtree comparison.
