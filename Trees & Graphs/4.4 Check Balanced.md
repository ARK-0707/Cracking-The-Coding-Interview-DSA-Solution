# 4.4 Check Balanced

## Description
Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced.For the purpose of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the height of two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

### Implementation Details
The `TreeNode` class represents each node in the tree, containing left and right children and a value. 

Here's a breakdown of the functions implemented:

- **`checkHeight(node)`**: Recursively calculates the height of each node's subtrees and checks if the tree is balanced. If the tree is found to be unbalanced at any node, it propagates an error value up the recursive calls.
- **`isBalanced(root)`**: Utilizes `checkHeight` to determine if the entire tree is balanced. It returns `True` if the tree is balanced and `False` otherwise.

### Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    root1 = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3, TreeNode(6), TreeNode(7)))
    result1 = isBalanced(root1)
    print("Balanced") if result1 else print("Unbalanced")

    root2 = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(3, None, TreeNode(4, None, TreeNode(5, None, TreeNode(6)))))
    result2 = isBalanced(root2)
    print("Balanced") if result2 else print("Unbalanced")
```

### Explanation
The `checkHeight` function is key to determining if the tree is balanced. It computes the height of the left and right subtrees for each node and checks the difference in height. If the difference exceeds 1, it returns an error value (`float('-inf')`). If no unbalanced subtree is found, it returns the height of the current subtree. The `isBalanced` function calls `checkHeight` on the root and checks if an error value is returned.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This is due to the space required for the recursion stack.

### Python Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def checkHeight(node):
    if node is None:
        return -1

    left_height = checkHeight(node.left)
    if left_height == float('-inf'):
        return float('-inf')  # pass error up

    right_height = checkHeight(node.right)
    if right_height == float('-inf'):
        return float('-inf')  # pass error up

    height_diff = left_height - right_height
    if abs(height_diff) > 1:
        return float('-inf')
    else:
        return max(left_height, right_height) + 1

def isBalanced(root):
    return checkHeight(root) != float('-inf')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root1 = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3, TreeNode(6), TreeNode(7)))
    result1 = isBalanced(root1)
    print("Balanced") if result1 else print("Unbalanced")

    root2 = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(3, None, TreeNode(4, None, TreeNode(5, None, TreeNode(6)))))
    result2 = isBalanced(root2)
    print("Balanced") if result2 else print("Unbalanced")
```

This implementation effectively checks if a binary tree is balanced by ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of every node does not exceed one.
