# 4.6 Successor

## Description
Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parent.

### Implementation Details
The `Node` class represents each node in the binary search tree, containing left and right children, a value, and a link to its parent.

Here's a breakdown of the functions implemented:

- **`Successor(node)`**: Finds the in-order successor of the given node.
  - If the node has a right child, the successor is the minimum value node in the right subtree (`findMin`).
  - If the node does not have a right child, the successor is the lowest ancestor for which the given node is in its left subtree.
- **`findMin(node)`**: Finds the minimum value node in the given subtree by traversing to the leftmost node.
- **`insertNode(root, value)`**: Inserts a new node with the given value into the binary search tree, ensuring that each node has a link to its parent.

### Example Usage



```python
#                                          15
#                                         /  \
#                                       10   20
#                                     /  \  /  \
#                                    8  12 17  25
#                                       /     / \
#                                      11   22  27


if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Node(15)
    insertNode(root, 10)
    insertNode(root, 20)
    insertNode(root, 8)
    insertNode(root, 12)
    insertNode(root, 17)
    insertNode(root, 25)
    insertNode(root, 11)
    insertNode(root, 22)
    insertNode(root, 27)

    node1 = root.left.right
    successor = Successor(node1)
    if successor:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node1.value} is {successor.value}")
    else:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node1.value} does not exist.")

    node2 = root.left
    successor = Successor(node2)
    if successor:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node2.value} is {successor.value}")
    else:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node2.value} does not exist.")
```

### Explanation
The `Successor` function determines the in-order successor of a given node in a binary search tree by checking whether the node has a right child. If it does, the successor is the minimum value node in the right subtree. If not, the successor is found by traversing up the tree until a node is found that is the left child of its parent. This parent is the successor.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the function might have to traverse from the given node to the root.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as no additional space is used other than the input and a few variables for traversal.

### Python Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None

def Successor(node):
    if node.right:
        return findMin(node.right)
    else:
        successor = None
        ancestor = node.parent
        while ancestor and node == ancestor.right:
            node = ancestor
            ancestor = ancestor.parent
        successor = ancestor
        return successor

def findMin(node):
    while node.left:
        node = node.left
    return node

def insertNode(root, value):
    if root is None:
        return Node(value)
    if value < root.value:
        if root.left is None:
            root.left = Node(value)
            root.left.parent = root
        else:
            insertNode(root.left, value)
    else:
        if root.right is None:
            root.right = Node(value)
            root.right.parent = root
        else:
            insertNode(root.right, value)
    return root

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Node(15)
    insertNode(root, 10)
    insertNode(root, 20)
    insertNode(root, 8)
    insertNode(root, 12)
    insertNode(root, 17)
    insertNode(root, 25)
    insertNode(root, 11)
    insertNode(root, 22)
    insertNode(root, 27)

    node1 = root.left.right
    successor = Successor(node1)
    if successor:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node1.value} is {successor.value}")
    else:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node1.value} does not exist.")

    node2 = root.left
    successor = Successor(node2)
    if successor:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node2.value} is {successor.value}")
    else:
        print(f"In-Order successor of {node2.value} does not exist.")
```

This implementation effectively demonstrates how to find the in-order successor of a node in a binary search tree, utilizing both tree traversal and parent links for efficient navigation.
