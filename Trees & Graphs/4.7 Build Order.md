# 4.7 Build Order

## Description
You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects, where the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order, return an error.

### Implementation Details
The solution uses a directed graph to represent the projects and their dependencies. The graph is built using adjacency lists, and a dictionary is used to keep track of the in-degree (number of incoming edges) of each node (project).

Here's a breakdown of the classes and functions implemented:

- **`Graph`**: Represents the graph with methods to add edges and track in-degrees.
  - **`__init__(projects)`**: Initializes the graph and in-degree dictionary.
  - **`add_edge(start, end)`**: Adds an edge from `start` to `end` and updates the in-degree of `end`.
- **`find_build_order(projects, dependencies)`**: Finds a valid build order using topological sorting (Kahn's Algorithm).
  - Initializes the graph and adds edges based on the dependencies.
  - Finds all nodes with no incoming edges (in-degree 0) and processes them.
  - Decreases the in-degree of all adjacent nodes and adds nodes with in-degree 0 to the queue.
  - Checks for cyclic dependencies and returns the build order if valid.

### Example Usage
Inputs:
- projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
- dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)\
Output: f, e, a, b, d, c

### Explanation
The algorithm constructs the graph and uses a queue to process nodes with in-degree 0 (projects that can be built without any dependencies). It processes each node, updating the in-degrees of its neighbors and adding neighbors with in-degree 0 to the queue. If the build order does not contain all projects, it indicates the presence of a cycle, making a valid build order impossible.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(P + D)\), where \(P\) is the number of projects and \(D\) is the number of dependencies. This is because each project and dependency is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(P + D)\), due to the storage required for the graph and in-degree dictionary.

### Python Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, projects):
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)
        self.in_degree = {project: 0 for project in projects}

    def add_edge(self, start, end):
        self.graph[start].append(end)
        self.in_degree[end] += 1

def find_build_order(projects, dependencies):
    # Initialize the graph
    graph = Graph(projects)

    # Add edges based on dependencies
    for start, end in dependencies:
        graph.add_edge(start, end)

    # Find all nodes with no incoming edges (in-degree 0)
    queue = deque([project for project in projects if graph.in_degree[project] == 0])

    build_order = []

    # Process nodes with in-degree 0
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        build_order.append(current)

        # Decrease the in-degree of all adjacent nodes
        for neighbor in graph.graph[current]:
            graph.in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            # If in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue
            if graph.in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # If build_order does not contain all projects, there's a cycle
    if len(build_order) != len(projects):
        return "Error: No valid build order (cyclic dependencies detected)"

    return build_order

# Example usage
projects = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
dependencies = [('a', 'd'), ('f', 'b'), ('b', 'd'), ('f', 'a'), ('d', 'c')]

build_order = find_build_order(projects, dependencies)
print("Build Order:", build_order)
```

This implementation effectively finds a valid build order for the given projects and dependencies or detects if no such order exists due to cyclic dependencies.
