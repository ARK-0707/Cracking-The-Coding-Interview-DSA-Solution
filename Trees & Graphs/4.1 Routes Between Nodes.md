# 4.1 Route Between Nodes

## Description
Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

### Implementation Details
The `Graph` class uses a list of lists to represent the adjacency list of the graph. The `Edge` class is used to represent an edge between two nodes.

Here's a breakdown of the methods implemented:

- **`createGraph(edges)`**: Adds edges to the graph from a list of edge tuples.
- **`printGraph()`**: Prints the graph's adjacency list.
- **`Routes(start, end, visited)`**: Uses DFS to check if there's a route from `start` to `end`. The `visited` list keeps track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.

### Example Usage

**Example**
- There is no path from 0 to 6 so the answer is *`False`*.
- There is a path from 2 to 3 so the answer is *`True`*.


### Explanation
This implementation creates a directed graph and checks for the existence of a route between two nodes using DFS. It starts from the `start` node and recursively visits its neighbors until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts all possibilities. The `visited` list ensures each node is processed only once, preventing infinite loops.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges. This is because each vertex and edge is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V)\), due to the space required for the `visited` list and the recursion stack in the DFS.

### Python Code

```python
class Edge:
    def __init__(self, src, dest):
        self.src = src
        self.dest = dest


class Graph:
    def __init__(self, v):
        self.vertices = v
        self.graph = [[] for _ in range(self.vertices)]

    def createGraph(self, edges):
        for src, dest in edges:
            self.graph[src].append(Edge(src, dest))

    def printGraph(self):
        for i in range(self.vertices):
            for edge in self.graph[i]:
                print(f"{edge.src} -> {edge.dest}")

    def Routes(self, start, end, visited):
        if start == end:
            return True
        visited[start] = True
        for e in self.graph[start]:
            if not visited[e.dest]:
                if self.Routes(e.dest, end, visited):
                    return True
        return False


if __name__ == '__main__':
    edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)]
    v1 = max(max(src, dest) for src, dest in edges) + 1

    graph = Graph(v1)
    graph.createGraph(edges)

    visited = [False] * v1
    result = graph.Routes(0, 6, visited)
    print(f"Route between 0 and 6: {result}")

    visited = [False] * v1
    result1 = graph.Routes(2, 3, visited)
    print(f"Route between 2 and 3: {result1}")
```

This implementation effectively demonstrates how to find a route between two nodes in a directed graph using depth-first search.
