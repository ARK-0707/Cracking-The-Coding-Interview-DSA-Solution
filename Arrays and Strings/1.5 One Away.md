# 1.5 One Away

## Description
There are 3 types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

**Example**\
pale, ple -> true\
pales, pale -> true\
pale, bale -> true\
pale, bake -> false

## Explanation
The oneAway function checks if two strings are at most one edit away from being identical. An edit is defined as inserting, deleting, or replacing a single character. The function first checks if the length difference between the two strings is greater than one, returning False if it is, since more than one edit would be needed. It then identifies the longer and shorter string. Using two pointers, it compares characters from both strings. If a mismatch is found, it checks if this is the second difference detected; if so, it returns False. If it is the first difference, it marks found_difference as True. If the strings are of different lengths, the pointer in the longer string is advanced to account for a potential insertion or deletion. Finally, the function returns True if at most one difference was found, indicating the strings are one edit away from being identical.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the oneAway function is 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the length of the shorter string. This is because, in the worst case, the function will need to compare each character of both strings once, moving through them with the two pointers.
#### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity of the function is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra space. The variables index1, index2, and found_difference do not depend on the input size and thus require a fixed amount of memory.
### Python Code

```python
def oneAway(s1, s2):
    # Length check
    if abs(len(s1) - len(s2)) > 1:
        return False

    # Identify the shorter and longer string
    if len(s1) > len(s2):
        longer, shorter = s1, s2
    else:
        longer, shorter = s2, s1

    # Two pointers to compare characters
    index1 = 0
    index2 = 0
    found_difference = False

    while index1 < len(longer) and index2 < len(shorter):
        if longer[index1] != shorter[index2]:
            if found_difference:
                return False
            found_difference = True
            # If lengths are different, move pointer in longer string
            if len(longer) != len(shorter):
                index1 += 1
                continue
        index1 += 1
        index2 += 1

    return True

# Example usage
print(oneAway("pale", "ple"))   # True
print(oneAway("pales", "pale")) # True
print(oneAway("pale", "bale"))  # True
print(oneAway("pale", "bake"))  # False
```
