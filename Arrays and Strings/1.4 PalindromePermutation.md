# 1.4 Palindrome Permuation

## Description
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards & backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

## Explanation
The palindromePermutation function determines if a given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome. It first normalizes the input by removing spaces and converting all characters to lowercase. Then, it creates a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in the string. After populating this dictionary, the function checks how many characters have an odd frequency count. For the string to be a permutation of a palindrome, there must be at most one character with an odd count, since a palindrome can have at most one character that appears an odd number of times (in the center of the palindrome). The function returns True if this condition is met, otherwise it returns False.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is ùëÇ(ùëõ), where ùëõ is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once to create the character count dictionary and once more to check the counts.
#### Space Complexity:

-The space complexity is O(1). Although we use a dictionary to count characters, the number of possible characters (in the context of the ASCII character set) is fixed and does not grow with the size of the input string.
### Python Code

```python
def palindromePermutation(s):
    # Normalize the string: remove spaces and convert to lowercase
    s = s.replace(" ", "").lower()

    # Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each character
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1

    # Check the number of characters with an odd count
    odd_count = 0
    for count in char_count.values():
        if count % 2 != 0:
            odd_count += 1

    # For the string to be permutation of a palindrome
    # there must be at most one character with an odd count
    return odd_count <= 1

s = "Tact Coa"
result = palindromePermutation(s)
print(f"Is '{s}' a permutation of a palindrome? {result}")
```
