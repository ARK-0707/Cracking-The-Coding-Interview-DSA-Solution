# 1.9 String Rotation

## Description
Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, write code to check if `s2` is a rotation of `s1` using only one call to `isSubstring` (e.g. "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").

**Example**

`waterbottle` is a rotation of `erbottlewat`\
`hello` is not a rotation of `world`

## Explanation
The `isRotation` function checks if `s2` is a rotation of `s1`. To determine this, the function first checks if the lengths of the two strings are the same. If they are not, the function returns `False`. If they are the same length, the function concatenates `s1` with itself, creating a new string `s1s1`. If `s2` is a substring of `s1s1`, then `s2` is a rotation of `s1`.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `isRotation` function is ùëÇ(ùëõ), where ùëõ is the length of the strings. This is because the `isSubstring` method (using the `in` operator) checks if `s2` is a substring of `s1s1`, which takes linear time in the worst case.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is ùëÇ(ùëõ) due to the creation of the `s1s1` string, which is twice the length of `s1`.

### Python Code

```python
def isRotation(s1, s2):
    # Check if lengths are the same
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return False
    # Concatenate s1 with itself
    s1s1 = s1 + s1
    # Check if s2 is a substring of s1s1
    return isSubstring(s1s1, s2)

def isSubstring(s1, s2):
    return s2 in s1

# Example usage
s1 = "waterbottle"
s2 = "erbottlewat"
print(isRotation(s1, s2))  # Output: True

s1 = "hello"
s2 = "world"
print(isRotation(s1, s2))  # Output: False
```

By following this structure, the function can effectively determine if one string is a rotation of another, providing a clear understanding of its process and complexity.
