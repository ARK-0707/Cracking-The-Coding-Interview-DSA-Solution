# 1.8 Zero Matrix

## Description
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

**Example**

Before Setting Zeroes:
```
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 5 0 9
8 4 5 6 7
```

After Setting Zeroes:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 0 7
```

## Explanation
The `zeroMatrix` function takes an MxN matrix and sets the entire row and column to 0 if an element in that row or column is 0. It uses two auxiliary lists to keep track of the rows and columns that need to be zeroed. First, it iterates through the matrix to identify the zeroes and marks the corresponding rows and columns. Then, it iterates through the matrix again to set the identified rows and columns to 0.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `zeroMatrix` function is 𝑂(𝑚 * 𝑛), where 𝑚 is the number of rows and 𝑛 is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because the function iterates through each element in the matrix twice: once to identify zeroes and once to set the rows and columns to zero.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is 𝑂(𝑚 + 𝑛) due to the auxiliary lists `row` and `col` used to store the indices of rows and columns that need to be zeroed.

### Python Code

```python
def zeroMatrix(matrix):
    m = len(matrix)
    n = len(matrix[0])

    row = [0] * m
    col = [0] * n

    # Identify rows and columns to be zeroed
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                row[i] = 1
                col[j] = 1

    # Set the identified rows and columns to zero
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if row[i] or col[j]:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    return matrix

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    [2, 0, 5, 0, 9],
    [8, 4, 5, 6, 7]
]

result = zeroMatrix(matrix)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

By following this structure, the function can effectively zero out the necessary rows and columns in an MxN matrix, providing a clear understanding of its process and complexity.
