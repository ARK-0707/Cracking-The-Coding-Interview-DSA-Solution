# 1.2 URLify

## Description
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

## Approach: Using replace() method

### Explanantion
The intuition behind this approach is that the URL-encoding of a space character is "%20", and the *replace()* method provides a convenient way to perform this substitution across the entire input string.

This approach is efficient and easy to understand, as it leverages the built-in functionality of the programming language without the need for custom string manipulation logic.

### Python Code

```python
def URLify(s):
    return s.replace(" ", "%20")
s = "Mr John Smith"
result = URLify(s)
print(result)
```
### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)** because replace() function iterates through the entire string to find and replace of the space character.
#### Space Complexity:

- **O(n)** as well, as the function creates a new string with the replaced characters, which has the same length as the input string.
