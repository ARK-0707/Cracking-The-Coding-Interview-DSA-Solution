# 1.7 Rotate Matrix

## Description
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. The rotation should be done in place.

**Example**

Before Rotation:
```
01 02 03 04
05 06 07 08
09 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
```

After Rotation:
```
13 09 05 01
14 10 06 02
15 11 07 03
16 12 08 04
```

## Explanation
The `rotateMatrix` function rotates a given NxN matrix by 90 degrees in place. The function first checks if the matrix is square. If it is not, the function returns `False`. If it is square, the function proceeds with the rotation by first transposing the matrix (swapping rows with columns) and then reversing each row to complete the 90-degree rotation.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `rotateMatrix` function is ùëÇ(ùëõ^2), where ùëõ is the dimension of the matrix. This is because the function iterates through each element in the matrix to transpose it and then again to reverse each row.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the function is ùëÇ(1) as it performs the rotation in place without using any extra space proportional to the input size.

### Python Code

```python
def rotateMatrix(matrix):
    # Check if the matrix is squared
    if len(matrix) == 0 or len(matrix) != len(matrix[0]):
        return False

    n = len(matrix)

    # Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

    # Reverse each row
    for row in matrix:
        row.reverse()

    return matrix

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15, 16]
]

result = rotateMatrix(matrix)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

By following this structure, the function can effectively rotate an NxN matrix by 90 degrees in place, providing a clear understanding of its process and complexity.
