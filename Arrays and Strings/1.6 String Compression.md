# 1.6 String Compression

## Description
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

**Example**\
aabcccccaaa -> a2b1c5a3\
abcdef -> abcdef

## Explanation
The `stringCompression` function compresses a string by counting the occurrences of each character and appending the character followed by its count to a new list. If the compressed string is longer than or equal to the original string, the original string is returned. Otherwise, the compressed string is returned.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `stringCompression` function is 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the length of the input string. This is because the function iterates through each character in the string once.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is 𝑂(𝑛) as well. The list `compressStr` used for constructing the compressed string could potentially hold up to twice the length of the original string in the worst case (e.g., every character being unique).

### Python Code

```python
def stringCompression(s):
    # Initialize an array and count variable to count the occurrences
    count = 0
    compressStr = []

    # Loop through the string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Add the first character to the array and initialize the count
        if i == 0:
            compressStr.append(s[i])
            count += 1
        # If character is equal to the previous one then increase the count
        elif s[i] == s[i - 1]:
            count += 1
        # If character is not equal then add the count, reset the count value to 1 & add the new element to the array
        else:
            compressStr.append(str(count))
            count = 1
            compressStr.append(s[i])

    # Add the last count in the array
    compressStr.append(str(count))
    # If compressed string length >= original string length, return original string; otherwise, return compressed string
    if len(compressStr) >= len(s):
        return s
    else:
        return "".join(compressStr)

# Example usage
s = "aabcccccaaa"
result = stringCompression(s)
print(result)  # Output: a2b1c5a3
```

By following this structure, the function can effectively compress strings and provide a clear understanding of its process and complexity.
