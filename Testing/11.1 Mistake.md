# 11.1 Mistake

## Problem Description
Find the mistake(s) in the following code:
```
unsigned int i;
for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i)
    printf("%d\n", i);
```

## Solution

The code has a logical issue because of how unsigned integers work. Letâ€™s analyze it step by step:

### The Problem

1. **Unsigned Integer Behavior**:
   - The variable `i` is declared as `unsigned int`. Unsigned integers can only hold non-negative values.
   - When `i` reaches `0` and the loop decrements it further (`--i`), the value underflows, wrapping around to the maximum possible value for `unsigned int` (e.g., $`2^{32} - 1`$ for 32-bit systems).

2. **Infinite Loop**:
   - Since `i` never becomes less than `0` (as it's unsigned), the loop will never terminate. Instead, it keeps wrapping around after reaching `0`.

### Correcting the Code

To fix the issue, we need to:
1. Use a **signed integer** for `i` if we need to check against negative values.
2. Alternatively, rewrite the loop logic to work properly with unsigned integers.

#### Solution 1: Use a `signed int`
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i;  // Use signed int
    for (i = 100; i >= 0; --i) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

#### Solution 2: Adjust the Loop for `unsigned int`
Since `unsigned int` cannot be less than `0`, change the condition to terminate correctly:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int i;
    for (i = 100; i != (unsigned int)(-1); --i) {
        printf("%u\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This ensures the loop runs until the unsigned integer underflows back to its maximum value. However, this solution is less intuitive and might not be what you intended.

### Preferred Solution
In most cases, **Solution 1** is better because it aligns with the intention of counting down to `0`. Using a `signed int` avoids the complications of unsigned arithmetic.

### Key Takeaways
1. Be cautious when using unsigned integers in conditions involving negative values or decrements.
2. Understand the behavior of underflow and overflow for signed and unsigned integers.
