# 11.3 Chess Test

## Problem Description

We have the following method used in a chess game: `boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y)`. This method is the part of `Piece` class and returns whether or not the piece can move to position `(x, y)`. Explain how you would test this method.

---

## Solution

To test the `canMoveTo(int x, int y)` method in Python, we can write unit tests using a testing framework like `unittest`. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Steps to Test
1. **Setup**: Create a mock chessboard and instances of different pieces (`Pawn`, `Knight`, etc.).
2. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Valid moves for each piece according to chess rules.
   - Invalid moves (e.g., moves that are out of bounds or not allowed by the piece's movement rules).
   - Edge cases (e.g., moving to the same position, boundary of the chessboard).
3. **Assertions**: Verify the output of `canMoveTo` for each scenario.

### Implementation in Python

Hereâ€™s how you might implement the tests for a chessboard with a `Piece` class and subclasses for specific pieces:

#### Example Classes
```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def canMoveTo(self, x, y):
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be overridden in subclasses.")

class Pawn(Piece):
    def canMoveTo(self, x, y):
        # Example rule for Pawn: Can move one step forward
        return x == self.x and y == self.y + 1

class Knight(Piece):
    def canMoveTo(self, x, y):
        # Knight can move in an "L" shape
        dx, dy = abs(x - self.x), abs(y - self.y)
        return (dx == 2 and dy == 1) or (dx == 1 and dy == 2)
```

#### Unit Tests
```python
import unittest

class TestChessPieces(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_pawn(self):
        pawn = Pawn(4, 4)
        # Valid move
        self.assertTrue(pawn.canMoveTo(4, 5))
        # Invalid move
        self.assertFalse(pawn.canMoveTo(5, 5))
        self.assertFalse(pawn.canMoveTo(4, 6))

    def test_knight(self):
        knight = Knight(4, 4)
        # Valid moves
        self.assertTrue(knight.canMoveTo(6, 5))
        self.assertTrue(knight.canMoveTo(5, 6))
        # Invalid moves
        self.assertFalse(knight.canMoveTo(4, 5))
        self.assertFalse(knight.canMoveTo(5, 5))

    def test_edge_cases(self):
        pawn = Pawn(0, 0)
        knight = Knight(7, 7)
        # Edge of the board
        self.assertFalse(pawn.canMoveTo(0, -1))  # Out of bounds
        self.assertFalse(knight.canMoveTo(8, 9))  # Out of bounds

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

---

### Explanation
1. **Test Cases for `Pawn`**:
   - It can only move one step forward.
   - Check valid and invalid moves, including moves outside the board.

2. **Test Cases for `Knight`**:
   - It moves in an "L" shape. Test all valid "L" moves.
   - Ensure invalid moves are caught.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Moving to a position outside the chessboard.
   - Ensure boundaries are respected.

### Expected Output
Running the tests should output:
```
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

OK
```

This ensures the `canMoveTo` method works as intended for different chess pieces and scenarios.
