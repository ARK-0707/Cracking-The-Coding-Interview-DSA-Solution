# 12.7 Virtual Base Class

## Problem Description
Why does a destructor in base class need to be declared virtual?

---

## Solution

Declaring the destructor in a base class as **virtual** is crucial in C++ when you use polymorphism. This ensures that the destructor of the **derived class** is correctly called when a base class pointer or reference is used to delete a derived class object. Without a virtual destructor, only the base class's destructor would execute, leading to **resource leaks** or **undefined behavior**.

---

### **Why Is This Necessary?**

When a class has virtual functions, a base class pointer can point to a derived class object. If the destructor is **not virtual**, the destructor of the base class is called when the object is deleted via the base class pointer, ignoring the derived class's destructor. This happens because the destructor call is resolved **statically** at compile time unless it is virtual.

With a **virtual destructor**, the destructor call is resolved **dynamically** at runtime, ensuring that the destructors of both the base and derived classes are called in the correct order.

---

### **Example Without Virtual Destructor**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    ~Base() {  // Non-virtual destructor
        cout << "Base destructor called" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() {
        cout << "Derived destructor called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived(); // Base pointer to Derived object
    delete obj;                // Deleting via base pointer
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Base destructor called
```

#### **Explanation**:
- Only the `Base` class destructor is called.
- The `Derived` class destructor is **not** called, potentially leaving resources allocated in the `Derived` class (like dynamic memory) unreleased.

---

### **Example With Virtual Destructor**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() {  // Virtual destructor
        cout << "Base destructor called" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() {
        cout << "Derived destructor called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* obj = new Derived(); // Base pointer to Derived object
    delete obj;                // Deleting via base pointer
    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Derived destructor called
Base destructor called
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The `Base` class destructor is declared `virtual`.
- When the object is deleted, the `Derived` class destructor is called first, followed by the `Base` class destructor.
- This ensures proper cleanup of resources allocated in both the `Derived` and `Base` classes.

---

### **Key Points**

1. **Order of Destructor Calls**:
   - When the destructor is virtual, the derived class's destructor is called first, followed by the base class's destructor.
   - This ensures proper cleanup in a derived-to-base inheritance chain.

2. **Resource Leaks Without Virtual Destructor**:
   - If the derived class allocates resources (e.g., memory), failing to call its destructor could result in memory leaks or resource mismanagement.

3. **Polymorphism and Virtual Destructor**:
   - A destructor in a base class should always be virtual if the class is intended to be used polymorphically (i.e., with base class pointers pointing to derived objects).

4. **Performance Consideration**:
   - Making a destructor virtual has a negligible performance cost compared to the potential issues it prevents.

---

### **When Should You Not Use a Virtual Destructor?**

- If the class is not intended to be used as a base class or used polymorphically, declaring the destructor as virtual is unnecessary.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  class NonPolymorphic {
  public:
      ~NonPolymorphic() { // Non-virtual destructor is fine here
          cout << "Destructor called" << endl;
      }
  };
  ```

---

### **Summary**

- **Always declare destructors as `virtual` in base classes** if the class is meant to be used polymorphically.
- This ensures proper cleanup of derived class resources when a derived class object is deleted through a base class pointer.
- Without a virtual destructor, only the base class's destructor is called, potentially causing resource leaks and undefined behavior.
