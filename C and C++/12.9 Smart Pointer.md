# 12.9 Smart Pointer

## Problem Description
Write a smart pointer class. A smart pointer is a data type, usually implemented with templates, that simulates a pointer while also providing automatic garbage collection. It automatically counts the number of references to a `SmartPointer<T*>` object and frees the object of type T when the reference count hits zero.

---

### Implementation Details
The `SmartPointer` class uses **reference counting** to manage the lifetime of the object it points to. The class will:

- **Constructor**: Initialize a smart pointer to an object and set the reference count to 1.
- **Copy Constructor**: Copying a smart pointer should increment the reference count.
- **Assignment Operator**: When assigning one smart pointer to another, the reference counts are updated appropriately.
- **Destructor**: Decrements the reference count and deletes the object when it reaches zero.
- **Dereferencing**: Overload the `*` and `->` operators to allow access to the underlying object.

### Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
class SmartPointer {
private:
    T* ptr;             // Raw pointer to the object
    int* refCount;      // Pointer to the reference count

public:
    // Constructor
    SmartPointer(T* p = nullptr) : ptr(p) {
        refCount = new int(1); // Initialize reference count to 1
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    SmartPointer(const SmartPointer<T>& other) {
        ptr = other.ptr;
        refCount = other.refCount;
        (*refCount)++;  // Increment the reference count
    }

    // Assignment Operator
    SmartPointer<T>& operator=(const SmartPointer<T>& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            // Decrease reference count of the current object
            if (--(*refCount) == 0) {
                delete ptr;    // Delete the underlying object if no more references
                delete refCount; // Delete the reference count
            }

            // Copy the data from the other smart pointer
            ptr = other.ptr;
            refCount = other.refCount;
            (*refCount)++; // Increment the reference count
        }
        return *this;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~SmartPointer() {
        if (--(*refCount) == 0) {
            delete ptr;    // Delete the underlying object if no more references
            delete refCount; // Delete the reference count
        }
    }

    // Dereference operator
    T& operator*() const {
        return *ptr;
    }

    // Arrow operator
    T* operator->() const {
        return ptr;
    }

    // Accessor for the raw pointer
    T* get() const {
        return ptr;
    }

    // Access the reference count
    int getRefCount() const {
        return *refCount;
    }
};

class Test {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Test object is being used." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a smart pointer
    SmartPointer<Test> ptr1(new Test());
    ptr1->display();  // Accessing methods through smart pointer

    {
        SmartPointer<Test> ptr2 = ptr1;  // Reference count increases
        cout << "Reference count: " << ptr1.getRefCount() << endl;

        {
            SmartPointer<Test> ptr3(ptr2);  // Reference count increases
            cout << "Reference count: " << ptr2.getRefCount() << endl;
        }  // ptr3 goes out of scope, reference count decreases

        cout << "Reference count: " << ptr2.getRefCount() << endl;
    }  // ptr2 goes out of scope, reference count decreases

    cout << "Reference count: " << ptr1.getRefCount() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Smart Pointer Class**:
   - The `SmartPointer` class holds a raw pointer `ptr` and a reference count `refCount` (which is a dynamically allocated integer).
   - **Constructor**: Initializes the pointer and reference count to 1.
   - **Copy Constructor**: Copies the raw pointer and reference count, increments the reference count.
   - **Assignment Operator**: Handles proper memory management when one smart pointer is assigned to another, updating reference counts.
   - **Destructor**: Decreases the reference count, and if it reaches zero, deletes both the raw pointer and the reference count.
   - **Dereference and Arrow Operators**: Allow access to the underlying object via the smart pointer.

2. **Reference Counting**:
   - The reference count is managed through an integer pointer (`refCount`), ensuring that the object is only deleted when no references remain.
   - If an object is copied or assigned, the reference count is incremented, and when a smart pointer goes out of scope or is reassigned, the count is decremented.

3. **Automatic Garbage Collection**:
   - When the reference count reaches zero, the underlying object and the reference count itself are automatically deleted, simulating garbage collection.

---

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Constructor: `O(1)`
  - Copy Constructor/Assignment: `O(1)`
  - Destructor: `O(1)`
  - Dereference: `O(1)`
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - Each smart pointer has an associated reference count, so the space complexity is `O(1)` per smart pointer, not including the memory allocated for the object it points to.

---

### Example Usage

1. **Creating a Smart Pointer**: The `SmartPointer` class is used like a normal pointer but with automatic reference counting.
2. **Copying Smart Pointers**: When a smart pointer is copied, the reference count is incremented.
3. **Memory Management**: When the reference count drops to zero, the object is automatically deallocated, ensuring no memory leaks.

#### Output:
```
Test object is being used.
Reference count: 2
Reference count: 3
Reference count: 2
Reference count: 1
```

This implementation demonstrates how a smart pointer can manage an object's lifetime through reference counting, ensuring automatic and safe memory management in C++.
