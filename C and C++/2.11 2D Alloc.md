# 2.11 2D Alloc

## Problem Description
Write a function in C called `my2DAlloc` which allocates a two-dimensional array. Minimize the number of calls to malloc and make sure that the memory is accessible by the notation `arr[i][j]`.

### Implementation Details
To minimize the number of `malloc` calls:
- We will allocate a single contiguous block of memory to hold all the rows of the 2D array.
- We will then cast this block into a pointer to an array of pointers (`int**`) where each pointer represents a row.
- This avoids allocating each row separately, reducing the overhead of multiple `malloc` calls.

### Example Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int** my2DAlloc(int rows, int cols) {
    // Allocate a single block of memory to hold both rows and columns
    int** arr = (int**)malloc(rows * sizeof(int*) + rows * cols * sizeof(int));
    if (!arr) {
        return NULL;  // Memory allocation failed
    }

    // Pointer to the memory block after the initial allocation for rows
    int* data = (int*)(arr + rows);

    // Assign each row pointer to the correct position in the contiguous memory
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        arr[i] = data + i * cols;
    }

    return arr;
}

void my2DFree(int** arr) {
    if (arr) {
        free(arr);  // Free the entire allocated block
    }
}

int main() {
    int rows = 3;
    int cols = 4;

    // Allocate 2D array
    int** arr = my2DAlloc(rows, cols);
    if (arr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Initialize and print the 2D array
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            arr[i][j] = i * cols + j;  // Assign some values
            printf("%d ", arr[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    // Free the allocated memory
    my2DFree(arr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`my2DAlloc(int rows, int cols)`**:
   - We allocate memory in a single `malloc` call that reserves enough space for both the row pointers and the data itself.
   - First, we allocate space for `rows` pointers (one per row). This is the first part of the block.
   - Then, we allocate the actual data (the `cols * rows` number of integers) which will hold the elements of the array.
   - We then adjust the `arr` pointer to point to the start of the data section, and we assign each row pointer to the appropriate place in the contiguous block of memory.
   
2. **`my2DFree(int** arr)`**:
   - To deallocate the memory, we simply call `free(arr)` which frees the entire contiguous block allocated in `my2DAlloc`.

3. **Main Function**:
   - We demonstrate the allocation and initialization of the 2D array.
   - After populating the array with values, we print it to confirm that memory is being accessed in the standard `arr[i][j]` notation.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - `my2DAlloc`: `O(1)` — The allocation involves only one `malloc` call for the memory.
  - `my2DFree`: `O(1)` — Only one `free` call.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - $`O(rows \times cols)`$ — We allocate a single block of memory that can store all elements of the 2D array.

---

### Example Output

For the given example, where `rows = 3` and `cols = 4`, the output would be:

```
0 1 2 3 
4 5 6 7 
8 9 10 11 
```

### Summary
- The function `my2DAlloc` efficiently allocates a 2D array by minimizing the number of `malloc` calls and ensuring that the memory is accessed using the standard `arr[i][j]` syntax.
- The function is implemented with a single contiguous block of memory to store both the row pointers and the data, which optimizes memory allocation and deallocation.
