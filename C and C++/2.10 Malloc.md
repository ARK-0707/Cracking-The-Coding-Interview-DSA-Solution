# 2.10 Malloc

## Problem Description
Write an aligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory such that memory address returned is divisible by a specific power of two.

### Example

```
align_malloc(1000, 128) will return a memory address that is multiple of 128 and that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.

aligned_free() will free memory allocated by align_malloc.
```

### Implementation Details
- **`aligned_malloc(size_t size, size_t alignment)`**:
  - Allocates a block of memory of the given `size` while ensuring the memory address returned is aligned to a specified power of two (`alignment`).
  - The `alignment` must be a power of two, and the address returned will be divisible by that value.
  
- **`aligned_free(void* ptr)`**:
  - Frees memory that was allocated by `aligned_malloc`.
  - Ensures the memory is freed correctly.

The implementation typically involves allocating extra memory to handle alignment adjustments. We use `uintptr_t` to manipulate pointers and ensure the alignment constraint is met.

### Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <cassert>
#include <cstring>

void* align_malloc(size_t size, size_t alignment) {
    assert((alignment & (alignment - 1)) == 0 && "Alignment must be a power of two");

    // Allocate extra space for alignment and the actual size
    void* original = malloc(size + alignment - 1 + sizeof(void*));
    if (!original) {
        return nullptr; // Return null if allocation fails
    }

    // Align the memory address to the specified alignment
    uintptr_t addr = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(original);
    uintptr_t alignedAddr = (addr + alignment - 1 + sizeof(void*)) & ~(alignment - 1);

    // Store the original pointer just before the aligned memory to free it later
    reinterpret_cast<void**>(alignedAddr - sizeof(void*)) = original;

    return reinterpret_cast<void*>(alignedAddr);
}

void aligned_free(void* ptr) {
    if (ptr) {
        // Retrieve the original pointer from just before the aligned memory
        void* original = *reinterpret_cast<void**>(reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(ptr) - sizeof(void*));
        free(original); // Free the original allocated memory
    }
}

int main() {
    size_t size = 1000;
    size_t alignment = 128;

    // Allocate aligned memory
    void* ptr = align_malloc(size, alignment);
    if (ptr) {
        std::cout << "Memory allocated at address: " << ptr << std::endl;
        
        // Example usage: Write and read to the allocated memory
        memset(ptr, 0, size);
        
        // Free the allocated memory
        aligned_free(ptr);
    } else {
        std::cout << "Memory allocation failed." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`align_malloc(size, alignment)`**:
   - We assert that the `alignment` is a power of two to ensure correctness.
   - We allocate additional memory (`alignment - 1 + sizeof(void*)`) to adjust the memory address and ensure alignment. The `sizeof(void*)` is used to store the original pointer, which will be used later to free the memory.
   - After allocation, we calculate the aligned address using the bitwise operation: `(addr + alignment - 1 + sizeof(void*)) & ~(alignment - 1)`. This ensures that the address is aligned to the specified `alignment`.
   - We store the original pointer just before the aligned address, allowing us to free the memory properly later.

2. **`aligned_free(ptr)`**:
   - To free the memory, we retrieve the original pointer (stored just before the aligned address) and pass it to `free()`.

3. **`main()`**:
   - We demonstrate the usage by allocating 1000 bytes of memory aligned to 128 bytes, then write to the allocated memory, and finally free it.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - `align_malloc`: `O(1)` — Only a few pointer manipulations and a single call to `malloc`.
  - `aligned_free`: `O(1)` — Only a pointer dereferencing and call to `free`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - `align_malloc`: `O(1)` — Additional memory allocation is small, proportional to the alignment.

---

### Example Usage
When the program runs, it will:
- Allocate 1000 bytes of memory aligned to 128-byte boundaries.
- Print the address where the memory was allocated.
- Set the memory to zero using `memset`.
- Free the memory using `aligned_free`.

#### Sample Output:
```
Memory allocated at address: 0x7f79f7000800
```

This implementation ensures that memory is correctly aligned to the specified power of two and manages the memory efficiently. The `aligned_malloc` function provides a flexible, low-level way to allocate aligned memory, and `aligned_free` ensures proper deallocation without memory leaks.
