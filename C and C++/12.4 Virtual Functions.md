# 12.4 Virtual Functions

## Prolem Description
How do virtual functions work in C++?

### Virtual Functions in C++

**Virtual functions** are a way to achieve **runtime polymorphism** in C++. They allow a program to decide at runtime which function to invoke, depending on the type of object being referred to, not the type of the pointer or reference used to refer to it.

When a virtual function is declared in a base class and overridden in a derived class, the function call is resolved dynamically at runtime using a **vtable** (virtual table).

---

### How They Work

1. **Declaration**:
   - A virtual function is declared in the base class using the `virtual` keyword.
   - Any function with the same signature in the derived class is considered an override of the virtual function.

2. **Mechanism**:
   - When a class contains virtual functions, the compiler creates a **vtable** for that class.
   - The vtable is a table of pointers to the virtual functions of the class.
   - Each object of the class has a pointer, often called the **vptr**, which points to the vtable corresponding to the class.

3. **Dynamic Dispatch**:
   - When a virtual function is called using a pointer or reference to the base class, the vptr is used to look up the correct function address in the vtable, and the function is invoked.

### Example: Virtual Function in Action

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() { // Virtual function
        cout << "Base class display function" << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override { // Override base class virtual function
        cout << "Derived class display function" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* basePtr;       // Pointer to Base
    Derived derivedObj;  // Derived class object

    basePtr = &derivedObj;

    // Calls Derived's display function, not Base's
    basePtr->display();

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Explanation of Example

1. **Virtual Function Call**:
   - The `display` function in `Base` is declared as `virtual`.
   - When `basePtr->display()` is called, the program uses the vtable to determine the actual function to call.
   - Since `basePtr` points to a `Derived` object, `Derived::display()` is invoked.

2. **Key Points**:
   - If the `display` function in `Base` were not virtual, `Base::display()` would have been called, even though `basePtr` points to a `Derived` object.
   - The `override` keyword in `Derived` ensures that it is correctly overriding the base class function, helping to catch errors during compilation.

---

### Behind the Scenes: Vtable

- **For the Base Class**:
  - The vtable for `Base` contains a pointer to `Base::display()`.

- **For the Derived Class**:
  - The vtable for `Derived` contains a pointer to `Derived::display()`.

- **At Runtime**:
  - The `vptr` for the `Derived` object points to the vtable of `Derived`, ensuring `Derived::display()` is called.

### Output

```
Derived class display function
```

### Summary

- **Virtual functions** are key to runtime polymorphism in C++.
- They enable **dynamic dispatch** by resolving function calls based on the actual object type at runtime.
- Use cases include implementing behavior that varies depending on the specific derived class at runtime, such as in graphical systems, device drivers, or any scenario requiring polymorphic behavior.
