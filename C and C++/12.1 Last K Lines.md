# 12.1 Last K Lines

## Problem Description
Write a method to print the last K lines of an input file using C++.

### Implementation Details
The method uses a fixed-size circular buffer to store the last `K` lines read from the file. As lines are read sequentially, they replace older lines in the buffer, ensuring only the last `K` lines are retained.

- **`read_last_k_lines(filename, k)`**:
  - Opens the file for reading.
  - Reads each line and maintains a circular buffer of size `K`.
  - Outputs the last `K` lines after reaching the end of the file.

### C++ Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void printLastKLines(const string &filename, int k) {
    ifstream file(filename);
    if (!file.is_open()) {
        cerr << "Error: Could not open file " << filename << endl;
        return;
    }

    vector<string> buffer(k);
    int count = 0;

    string line;
    while (getline(file, line)) {
        buffer[count % k] = line;
        count++;
    }

    // Determine the starting point in the circular buffer
    int start = count > k ? count % k : 0;
    int linesToPrint = min(k, count);

    for (int i = 0; i < linesToPrint; i++) {
        cout << buffer[(start + i) % k] << endl;
    }

    file.close();
}

int main() {
    string filename = "example.txt"; // Replace with the path to your file
    int k = 5; // Number of last lines to print

    printLastKLines(filename, k);
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. The program reads the file line by line.
2. A circular buffer (`vector<string> buffer`) is used to store the last `K` lines.
3. The modulo operator ensures that the buffer overwrites the oldest line once it is full.
4. After reading all lines, the program calculates the starting position in the buffer to correctly print the last `K` lines in order.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of lines in the file. The file is read line by line in a single pass.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(K)`, where `K` is the number of lines to be stored in memory.

### Example Usage
Assume a file `example.txt` contains:
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
```

Running the program with `k = 3` will output:
```
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
```

This implementation ensures efficiency and handles large files gracefully by limiting memory usage to `O(K)`.
