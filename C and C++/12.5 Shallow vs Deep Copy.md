# 12.5 Shallow vs Deep Copy

## Problem Description
What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy? Explain how you would use each.

### **Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy**

A **deep copy** and a **shallow copy** are ways of copying objects in programming. They differ in how they handle the duplication of objects that contain references to other objects.

---

### **Shallow Copy**
A shallow copy creates a new object but **copies the references** of the nested objects (if any). As a result, changes made to the nested objects of the copy will also affect the original object since they share the same memory location.

#### Characteristics of Shallow Copy:
- The outer object is duplicated.
- The inner objects are **not** duplicated; only references to them are copied.

#### When to Use:
- Use shallow copies when the object contains immutable data or when you don't intend to modify the shared nested objects.

---

### **Deep Copy**
A deep copy creates a new object and **recursively duplicates all nested objects**. This ensures that the original and the copy are completely independent.

#### Characteristics of Deep Copy:
- Both the outer object and all nested objects are duplicated.
- Changes to the copy do not affect the original object and vice versa.

#### When to Use:
- Use deep copies when you need a complete and independent duplicate of the object.

---

### **Examples in C++**

#### Shallow Copy Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shallow {
    int* data;  // Pointer to dynamically allocated memory
public:
    Shallow(int value) {
        data = new int(value); // Allocate memory
    }

    // Default copy constructor performs shallow copy
    void display() const {
        cout << "Data: " << *data << endl;
    }

    ~Shallow() {
        delete data;  // Free allocated memory
    }
};

int main() {
    Shallow obj1(10);
    Shallow obj2 = obj1;  // Shallow copy (default behavior)

    obj1.display();
    obj2.display();

    // Both obj1 and obj2 share the same memory; destructor will cause issues.
    return 0;
}
```

#### Problem:
- Both `obj1` and `obj2` point to the same memory.
- Deleting one object causes undefined behavior when the other tries to access or delete the same memory.

---

#### Deep Copy Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Deep {
    int* data;  // Pointer to dynamically allocated memory
public:
    Deep(int value) {
        data = new int(value); // Allocate memory
    }

    // Deep copy constructor
    Deep(const Deep& source) {
        data = new int(*source.data); // Allocate new memory and copy value
    }

    void display() const {
        cout << "Data: " << *data << endl;
    }

    ~Deep() {
        delete data;  // Free allocated memory
    }
};

int main() {
    Deep obj1(10);
    Deep obj2 = obj1;  // Deep copy

    obj1.display();
    obj2.display();

    // Both obj1 and obj2 have independent memory.

    return 0;
}
```

#### Solution:
- Each object manages its own memory.
- Deleting one object does not affect the other.

### Key Differences

| Aspect                 | Shallow Copy                               | Deep Copy                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Copy Mechanism**     | Copies references to nested objects.       | Recursively copies all nested objects.   |
| **Memory Independence**| The original and copy share some memory.   | The original and copy are independent.   |
| **Performance**        | Faster because it doesn't duplicate data.  | Slower due to recursive duplication.     |
| **Use Case**           | When nested objects are immutable or shared. | When full independence is needed.       |

---

### Choosing Between Them

- **Shallow Copy**:
  - Faster and requires less memory.
  - Suitable when objects have shared ownership of nested data.
  - Example: Copying arrays of integers in a read-only context.

- **Deep Copy**:
  - Ensures full object independence.
  - Use when objects are modified independently or to avoid shared ownership.
  - Example: Copying configuration objects that will be modified independently.
