# 12.2 Reverse String

## Problem Description
Implement a function `void reverse(char* str)` in C or C++ which reverse a null terminated string.

### Implementation Details
The function operates directly on the input string, modifying it in place. Using two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end of the string, characters are swapped until the pointers meet.

### C++ Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void reverse(char* str) {
    if (str == nullptr) return; // Handle null pointer

    char* start = str;
    char* end = str;

    // Move `end` to the last character of the string
    while (*end != '\0') {
        end++;
    }
    end--; // Move back to the last character (ignoring '\0')

    // Swap characters until start and end pointers meet or cross
    while (start < end) {
        char temp = *start;
        *start = *end;
        *end = temp;

        start++;
        end--;
    }
}

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello, World!";
    cout << "Original String: " << str << endl;

    reverse(str);

    cout << "Reversed String: " << str << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Null Check**: Ensure the input is not a `nullptr`.
2. **Identify Bounds**:
   - Use the `start` pointer to reference the beginning of the string.
   - Move the `end` pointer to the last character by iterating until the null terminator is encountered.
3. **Swapping**: Swap characters at `start` and `end`, then move the pointers closer to each other.
4. **Stop Condition**: Stop when `start` and `end` meet or cross.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the string. Each character is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as the reversal is done in place.

### Example Usage
For the string `Hello, World!`:
- Original: `Hello, World!`
- Reversed: `!dlroW ,olleH`

The function efficiently reverses the string in place with no additional memory overhead.
