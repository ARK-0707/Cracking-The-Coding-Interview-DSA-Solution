# 6.5 Jugs of Water

## Problem Description
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note
that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

### Approach
1. **Mathematical Insight**: The problem can be solved if the target amount of water is a multiple of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two jug capacities. We can either fill or empty the jugs and pour water from one jug to the other, while keeping track of all possible states.
   
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: To explore all possible states, we use BFS. The state of the system is represented by a pair `(a, b)`, where `a` is the amount of water in the five-quart jug and `b` is the amount in the three-quart jug. We generate all possible valid states by performing actions like filling, emptying, or transferring water between the jugs.

3. **States and Actions**:
   - **Fill a jug**: Fill the five-quart or the three-quart jug to full capacity.
   - **Empty a jug**: Empty one of the jugs entirely.
   - **Transfer water between jugs**: Pour water from one jug into the other until one of the jugs is full or empty.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If the target amount of water is greater than the total capacity of both jugs combined, it's impossible to measure.
   - If the target amount is zero or equal to one of the jug's capacities, it is trivially solvable.

  | **5 Quart** | **3 Quart** |                **Action**               |
  |:-----------:|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------:|
  |      5      |      0      |           Filled 5-quart jug.           |
  |      2      |      3      | Filled 3-quart with 5-quart's contents. |
  |      2      |      0      |             Dumped 3-quart.             |
  |      0      |      2      |  Fill 3-quart with 5-quart's contents.  |
  |      5      |      2      |             Filled 5-quart.             |
  |      4      |      3      | Fill remainder of 3-quart with 5-quart. |
  |      4      |      0      |         Done! We have 4-quarts.         |

### Example Usage
```python
from collections import deque

# Helper function to check if the target can be achieved
def is_solvable(x, y, z):
    # If target z is greater than the total capacity, it's not solvable
    if z > x + y:
        return False
    # If z is zero or exactly matches the capacity of one jug, it's solvable
    if z == 0 or z == x or z == y:
        return True
    # Using GCD to check solvability
    return z % gcd(x, y) == 0

# Function to return the GCD of two numbers
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# BFS function to solve the Water Jug Problem
def water_jug_bfs(x, y, z):
    # To keep track of visited states
    visited = set()
    
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque()
    
    # Initialize the queue with the starting state (0, 0) - both jugs empty
    queue.append((0, 0))
    
    while queue:
        # Get the current state
        a, b = queue.popleft()
        
        # If we've reached the target
        if a == z or b == z or a + b == z:
            print(f"Solved: ({a}, {b})")
            return True
        
        # If this state has been visited before, skip it
        if (a, b) in visited:
            continue
        
        # Mark the current state as visited
        visited.add((a, b))
        
        # Generate all possible next states by performing valid actions
        
        # 1. Fill the first jug
        queue.append((x, b))
        # 2. Fill the second jug
        queue.append((a, y))
        # 3. Empty the first jug
        queue.append((0, b))
        # 4. Empty the second jug
        queue.append((a, 0))
        # 5. Pour from the first jug to the second jug
        transfer = min(a, y - b)
        queue.append((a - transfer, b + transfer))
        # 6. Pour from the second jug to the first jug
        transfer = min(b, x - a)
        queue.append((a + transfer, b - transfer))
    
    # If we exhaust the queue and haven't solved it
    print("No solution.")
    return False

# Example input
jug1 = 5  # capacity of jug 1
jug2 = 3  # capacity of jug 2
target = 4  # target

# Check if it's solvable and then solve it
if is_solvable(jug1, jug2, target):
    water_jug_bfs(jug1, jug2, target)
else:
    print("Not solvable.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mathematical Validation**: Before attempting to solve the problem, we check if it's even solvable by using the GCD of the jug capacities. If the target is a multiple of the GCD, the problem is solvable.

2. **BFS Approach**:
   - The BFS explores all possible states starting from `(0, 0)` (both jugs empty).
   - At each step, we perform all possible valid actions: filling, emptying, or transferring water between the jugs.
   - If any of these actions results in a state where either jug has exactly `z` quarts of water, we print the solution and stop the search.

3. **State Representation**: 
   - The state `(a, b)` represents the amount of water in jug 1 (`a` quarts) and jug 2 (`b` quarts).
   - We use a set `visited` to avoid revisiting the same state multiple times.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the target is greater than the combined capacity of both jugs, it's impossible to achieve.
   - If the target is zero or exactly equal to the capacity of one of the jugs, the solution is trivial.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of possible states that can be generated. Each state is explored once, and there are at most `(x + 1) * (y + 1)` states.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since we store the visited states in a set.

This approach uses BFS to explore all possible jug configurations and efficiently checks if it's possible to reach the target amount of water.
