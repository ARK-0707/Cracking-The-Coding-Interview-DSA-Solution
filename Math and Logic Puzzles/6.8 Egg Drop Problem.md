# 6.8 Egg Drop Problem

## Problem Description

There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. 
You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

### Approach

1. **Minimum Drops Calculation**:
    - The worst-case scenario is the one in which the first egg breaks as late as possible (i.e., on the Nth drop). The task is to minimize the maximum number of drops in this scenario.
    - The approach works by selecting floors with a decreasing interval. If an egg breaks, the remaining floors are explored one by one with the second egg to determine the exact critical floor.
    - The idea is to minimize the sum of the steps used so far and the remaining drops.

2. **Binary Search Simulation**:
    - We use the first egg to minimize the interval in which the critical floor can be found. If the first egg breaks, we start using the second egg to find the exact floor. We can calculate the optimal number of drops required using the formula $` (k * (k + 1)) / 2 `$, where `k` is the number of drops, and we continue reducing the interval after each drop.

3. **Simulate Dropping Eggs**:
    - We simulate the process by dropping the first egg from calculated intervals until it breaks. After it breaks, we switch to the second egg to test floors one by one from the last floor that didn't break the egg to the floor where it did.

### Example Usage
```python
import random

def find_critical_floor(N):
    """
    Function to find the critical floor using two eggs and minimizing the number of drops
    :param N: The critical floor (unknown during the process)
    :return: The critical floor found
    """
    # Number of floors in the building
    floors = 100
    
    # Minimum drops required
    drops = 0
    
    # Find minimum number of drops such that (drops * (drops + 1)) / 2 >= floors
    while (drops * (drops + 1)) // 2 < floors:
        drops += 1

    # Start from the calculated number of drops and decrement interval
    interval = drops
    current_floor = 0
    previous_floor = 0
    egg1_breaks = False

    # Drop the first egg
    while not egg1_breaks and current_floor <= floors:
        previous_floor = current_floor
        current_floor += interval
        interval -= 1
        if current_floor > floors:
            current_floor = floors
        # Simulate dropping the first egg
        egg1_breaks = drop_egg(current_floor, N)

    # Use the second egg to find the exact floor
    egg2_breaks = False
    for floor in range(previous_floor + 1, current_floor + 1):
        egg2_breaks = drop_egg(floor, N)
        if egg2_breaks:
            return floor

    return current_floor

def drop_egg(floor, N):
    """
    Simulates dropping an egg from a specific floor
    :param floor: The floor from which the egg is dropped
    :param N: The critical floor (unknown in real use case)
    :return: True if the egg breaks, False otherwise
    """
    return floor >= N

# Example usage
N = random.randint(0, 99)  # Randomly determine the critical floor
critical_floor = find_critical_floor(N)
print(f"The critical floor is: {critical_floor}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: First, we compute the minimum number of drops needed to cover all 100 floors in the worst-case scenario. We use a formula $`drops * (drops + 1) / 2 >= 100`$ to calculate this number. In this case, the number of drops required is 14.
  
- **Step 2**: We start by dropping the first egg from progressively higher floors, decreasing the interval by 1 after each drop (i.e., 14th floor, then 27th floor, then 39th, and so on).
  
- **Step 3**: If the first egg breaks, we use the second egg to test the floors one by one, starting from the last floor where the first egg didn't break.
  
- **Step 4**: If the second egg breaks, the floor where it breaks is the critical floor.

### Example Walkthrough:
If the critical floor `N` is 75, the algorithm might proceed as follows:
- Drop the first egg from the 14th floor. It doesn't break.
- Drop from the 27th floor. It doesn't break.
- Drop from the 39th floor. It doesn't break.
- Drop from the 50th floor. It doesn't break.
- Drop from the 60th floor. It doesn't break.
- Drop from the 69th floor. It doesn't break.
- Drop from the 77th floor. The first egg breaks.

Now, use the second egg to test floors one by one from the 70th to the 76th. When dropped from the 75th floor, the second egg breaks. Therefore, the critical floor is determined to be the 75th floor.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: $`O(\sqrt{ n })`$, where `n` is the number of floors. This is because the first egg is dropped with a decreasing interval, and in the worst case, we test floors sequentially with the second egg.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the solution only uses a few variables.

### Conclusion:
The solution optimizes the number of drops required to find the critical floor in the worst case scenario. By using decreasing intervals for the first egg and testing floor by floor with the second egg, the algorithm ensures that the critical floor is found with the minimum number of drops.
