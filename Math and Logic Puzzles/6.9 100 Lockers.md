# 6.9 100 Lockers

## Problem Description
There are 100 lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third
locker (closes it if it is open or opens if it is closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass `i`, the man toggles every `ith` locker.
After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only one locker #100, how many lockers are open?

### Approach

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - Each locker is toggled multiple times based on how many divisors its number has. For example, locker 6 is toggled on passes 1, 2, 3, and 6, because 6 has four divisors: 1, 2, 3, and 6. Each divisor represents a pass during which the locker is toggled.
   - A locker ends up open if and only if it is toggled an odd number of times.

2. **Perfect Squares**:
   - A locker is toggled an odd number of times if and only if it has a perfect square number. This is because only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. For instance, locker 9 is toggled on passes 1, 3, and 9 (since 9 has divisors 1, 3, and 9), which means it will end up being open.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The only lockers that remain open after 100 passes are those whose numbers are perfect squares. The number of perfect squares between 1 and 100 (inclusive) is the number of lockers that will remain open.

### Example Usage
```python
def count_open_lockers(n):
    """
    Counts the number of lockers that remain open after n passes.
    :param n: The total number of lockers and passes (usually 100).
    :return: The number of lockers that remain open.
    """
    open_lockers = 0
    # Check for each locker if its number is a perfect square
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (i ** 0.5).is_integer():
            open_lockers += 1
    return open_lockers

# Example usage
n = 100
open_lockers = count_open_lockers(n)
print(f"Number of open lockers: {open_lockers}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: We iterate through all 100 lockers and check if each locker number is a perfect square. We do this by taking the square root of each number and checking if it is an integer.
  
- **Step 2**: If a locker number is a perfect square (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, ...), it will remain open after all the passes. We count all such lockers and return the result.

### Walkthrough:
- For n = 100, the lockers whose numbers are perfect squares are:
  - $`1^2 = 1`$
  - $`2^2 = 4`$
  - $`3^2 = 9`$
  - $`4^2 = 16`$
  - $`5^2 = 25`$
  - $`6^2 = 36`$
  - $`7^2 = 49`$
  - $`8^2 = 64`$
  - $`9^2 = 81`$
  - $`10^2 = 100`$
  
Thus, the open lockers are the ones corresponding to these perfect squares, and there are 10 open lockers in total.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of lockers (100 in this case). The algorithm simply checks whether each locker number is a perfect square, which is done in constant time for each locker.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since only a few variables are used to store the count of open lockers.

### Conclusion:
The problem is solved by recognizing that only the lockers with perfect square numbers remain open after the 100 passes. This is because perfect squares have an odd number of divisors, resulting in an odd number of toggles.
