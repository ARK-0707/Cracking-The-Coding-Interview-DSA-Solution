# 6.10 Poison

## Problem Description
You have 1000 bottles of soda, and exactly one is poisoned. You have 10 test strips which can be used to detect poison. A single drop of poison will turn the test 
strip positive permanently. You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you'd like (as long as the results 
are negative). However, you can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as
possible?

### Approach:
1. **Binary Representation**:
   - You can represent the bottle IDs in binary using 10 bits since $`2^10 = 1024`$ covers all 1000 bottles.
   - The idea is to use each bit of the bottle's binary representation to decide whether to add a drop from that bottle to a particular test strip. This method ensures that the test strip results will form a unique binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.

2. **Test Strip Assignment**:
   - For each bottle, examine its binary representation. If a specific bit is set (i.e., it is `1`), add a drop from that bottle onto the corresponding test strip (where the bit index matches the test strip index).
   
3. **Interpreting Results**:
   - After 7 days, you will check the results. Each positive test strip corresponds to a `1` in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle. By combining the results from all strips, you can identify the poisoned bottle's ID.

### Example Usage
```python
import random

class Bottle:
    def __init__(self, bottle_id):
        self.bottle_id = bottle_id

    def get_id(self):
        return self.bottle_id


class TestStrip:
    def __init__(self, strip_id):
        self.strip_id = strip_id
        self.drops = {}

    def add_drop_on_day(self, day, bottle):
        if day not in self.drops:
            self.drops[day] = []
        self.drops[day].append(bottle.get_id())

    def is_positive_on_day(self, day):
        # Simulating a test strip being positive for a poison bottle after a certain day.
        # If any of the bottles with poison were tested on this strip, it returns True.
        return day in self.drops

    def get_id(self):
        return self.strip_id

    """

    run_tests(bottles, strips)

    return set_bits(positive_strips)


def run_tests(bottles, test_strips):

    for bottle in bottles:
        bottle_id = bottle.get_id()
        bit_index = 0
        while bottle_id > 0:
            if (bottle_id & 1) == 1:
                test_strips[bit_index].add_drop_on_day(0, bottle)
            bit_index += 1
            bottle_id >>= 1


def get_positive_on_day(test_strips, day):
    """
    Returns a list of test strips that returned a positive result on the given day.
    """
    positive_strips = []
    for test_strip in test_strips:
        if test_strip.is_positive_on_day(day):
            positive_strips.append(test_strip.get_id())
    return positive_strips


def set_bits(positive_strips):
    """

    poison_id = 0
    for bit_index in positive_strips:
        poison_id |= 1 << bit_index
    return poison_id


# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_bottles = 1000
    num_strips = 10

    bottles = [Bottle(bottle_id) for bottle_id in range(num_bottles)]
    test_strips = [TestStrip(strip_id) for strip_id in range(num_strips)]

    # Randomly select the poisoned bottle
    poisoned_bottle_id = random.randint(0, 999)
    print(f"The actual poisoned bottle is: {poisoned_bottle_id}")

    # Simulate the poisoned bottle turning a test strip positive
    for strip in test_strips:
        if poisoned_bottle_id & (1 << strip.get_id()):
            strip.add_drop_on_day(7, bottles[poisoned_bottle_id])  # Assume day 7 is the result day

    # Find the poisoned bottle using the test strips
    result = find_poison_bottle(bottles, test_strips)
    print(f"The poisoned bottle is bottle number: {result}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: For each bottle, we check its binary representation and assign drops of the bottle onto corresponding test strips based on which bits are set to `1`.
- **Step 2**: After 7 days, we check which test strips turned positive. The index of the positive test strips forms the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's ID.
- **Step 3**: We combine the positive test strip indices to form a binary number, which gives us the ID of the poisoned bottle.

### Example Walkthrough:
- Suppose the poisoned bottle is bottle number 325. Its binary representation is `101000101`. The method places drops from bottle 325 on test strips 0, 2, 5, and 8 (because these bits are `1`).
- After 7 days, test strips 0, 2, 5, and 8 will turn positive, allowing you to reconstruct the poisoned bottle's ID as `101000101` (325 in decimal).

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(b * s) \), where `b` is the number of bottles and `s` is the number of strips (1000 bottles and 10 strips). For each bottle, we loop through its binary representation, which has a fixed length of 10 bits.
- **Space Complexity**: O(b + s), where `b` is the number of bottles and `s` is the number of test strips.

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently identifies the poisoned bottle using binary representation and test strips, allowing us to find the bottle in a single round of tests (after waiting for 7 days for the results).
