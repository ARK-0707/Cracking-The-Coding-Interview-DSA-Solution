# 6.7 The Apocalypse

## Problem Description
In the new post-apocalyptic world, the world queen is desperately concerned about the birth rate. Therefore, she decrees that all families should ensure 
that they have one girl or else they face massive fines. If all families abide by this policy-that is, they have to continue to have children until they 
have one girl, at which point they immediately stop-what will the gender ratio of the new generation be? (Assume that the odds of someone having a boy or 
a girl on any given pregnancy are equal). Solve this out logically and then write a computer simulation of it.

### Explanation:

If each family abides by this policy, their sequence of children will consist of zero or more boys followed by exactly one girl. The sequence might look like this:

- G (a girl born first),
- BG (a boy, then a girl),
- BBG (two boys, then a girl),
- BBBG (three boys, then a girl), 
- and so on.

The probability of each sequence can be determined based on the chances of having a boy or a girl in any given pregnancy. The probabilities work out as follows:

- \(P(G) = \frac{1}{2}\) (50% of families will have a girl on the first try),
- \(P(BG) = \frac{1}{4}\) (50% of the remaining 50% will have a boy first, then a girl),
- \(P(BBG) = \frac{1}{8}\) (25% of families will have two boys before having a girl),
- and so on.

Since each family must eventually have one girl, the average number of boys each family will have can be calculated by looking at the expected value of the number of boys based on the sequence probabilities. This means we need to compute the sum of the number of boys weighted by the probability of each sequence:

| Sequence  | Number of Boys | Probability | Number of Boys * Probability |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| G         | 0              | 1/2         | 0                             |
| BG        | 1              | 1/4         | 1/4                           |
| BBG       | 2              | 1/8         | 2/8                           |
| BBBG      | 3              | 1/16        | 3/16                          |
| BBBBG     | 4              | 1/32        | 4/32                          |
| BBBBBG    | 5              | 1/64        | 5/64                          |
| BBBBBBG   | 6              | 1/128       | 6/128                         |

Summing these probabilities gives the expected value of the number of boys per family, which approaches 1. Thus, on average, each family has one boy and one girl. The overall population will have a roughly 50% gender ratio (50% boys and 50% girls).

### Conclusion:

Although this policy is designed to ensure every family has a girl, the probability of having boys and girls in the population as a whole remains 50/50. The reason for this is that the families which continue to have children are contributing additional boys to the population. Thus, the policy does not affect the overall gender ratio.

### Code Simulation:

```python
import random

def run_n_families(n):
    boys = 0
    girls = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        genders = run_one_family()
        girls += genders[0]
        boys += genders[1]
    return girls / (boys + girls)

def run_one_family():
    boys = 0
    girls = 0
    while girls == 0:  # Continue until a girl is born
        if random.choice([True, False]):  # True represents a girl, False a boy
            girls += 1
        else:
            boys += 1
    return [girls, boys]

# Run the simulation for n families
n = 1000
ratio = run_n_families(n)
print(f"Gender ratio (girls to total children): {ratio:.2f}")

# Output
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **`run_one_family()`**: This simulates a single family. The family continues to have children until a girl is born. It returns the number of girls (always 1) and the number of boys.
2. **`run_n_families(n)`**: This simulates `n` families and calculates the total number of girls and boys. It returns the ratio of girls to the total number of children (boys + girls).

### Mathematical Insight:
If each family abides by this policy, they will have exactly one girl. However, some families will have zero boys, while others will have one or more boys before they have a girl. The expected number of boys per family turns out to be 1, meaning the gender ratio will stabilize at 50% girls and 50% boys. This is because the biological probability of having a boy or a girl is equal, and stopping at a girl does not affect the underlying probability of gender distribution in the population.

### Conclusion:
Even though the policy ensures that every family has at least one girl, the overall gender ratio in the population remains 50/50. This is due to the fact that families having more boys will offset the "one girl" policy in terms of population statistics.
