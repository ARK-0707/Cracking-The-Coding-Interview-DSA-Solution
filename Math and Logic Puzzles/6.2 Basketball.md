## Basketball

### Problem Description

You have a basketball hoop, and you can choose to play one of two games:
- **Game 1**: You get one shot to make the hoop.
- **Game 2**: You get three shots, and you have to make at least two out of three shots.

Given that `p` is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of `p` should you choose one game over the other?

### Approach

1. **Calculate the Probability of Winning Game 1**:
   - In Game 1, you need to make one shot out of one. The probability of winning Game 1 is simply `p`.

2. **Calculate the Probability of Winning Game 2**:
   - In Game 2, you need to make at least two out of three shots. This can happen in two ways:
     - Making exactly two shots out of three.
     - Making all three shots.

### Mathematical Calculation

1. **Probability of Winning Game 1**: `P(Game 1) = p`

2. **Probability of Winning Game 2**:
   - **Probability of making exactly two shots out of three**: `P(2, 3) = 3 * p^2 * (1 - p)`
     This accounts for the three different ways to make two shots and miss one.

   - **Probability of making all three shots**: `P(3, 3) = p^3`

   - **Total Probability of Winning Game 2**: `P(winning) = P(2, 3) + P(3, 3) = 3p^2(1 - p) + p^3 = 3p^2 - 2p^3`

3. **Determine Which Game to Play**:
   - Compare the probabilities of winning each game:
     \
     `p > 3p^2 - 2p^3`
   - Simplify the inequality:
     \
     `1 > 3p - 2p^2`
     \
     `2p^2 - 3p + 1 < 0`
   - Factor the quadratic equation:
     \
     `(2p - 1)(p - 1) < 0`
   - Solve the inequality:
     - The solution to this inequality is \( 0 < p < 0.5 \).

   - Therefore, you should:
     - `**Play Game 1** if ( 0 < p < 0.5 ).`
     - `**Play Game 2** if ( 0.5 < p < 1 ).`
