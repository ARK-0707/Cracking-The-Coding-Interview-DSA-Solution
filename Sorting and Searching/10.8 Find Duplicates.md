# 10.8 Find Duplicates

## Problem Description

You have an array with all the numbers from `1 to N`, where `N` is at most `32,000`. The array may have duplicate entries and you do not know what N is. With only `4 kilobytes` of memory available, how would you print all the duplicate elements in the array?

## Solution

To solve this problem with only `4 kilobytes (4 KB)` of memory available, we can use a **bit vector** to efficiently track which numbers have been seen. Here's how the algorithm works:

### Key Insights
1. **Memory Constraints**:
   - 4 KB = 4 $\times$ 1024 bytes = 32,768 bits, which is sufficient to track numbers from 1 to 32,000 using one bit per number.

2. **Bit Vector**:
   - A bit vector is an array of bits where each bit represents the presence (or absence) of a number.
   - If the bit for a number is already set, that number is a duplicate.

3. **Array Iteration**:
   - Iterate through the array, and for each number, check if its corresponding bit in the bit vector is already set.
   - If the bit is not set, mark it. If it is already set, print the number as a duplicate.

### Algorithm

#### **Step 1: Initialize a Bit Vector**
- Use a bit array with \(32,000\) bits (4 KB memory).
- Set all bits to `0`.

#### **Step 2: Process the Array**
- For each number in the array:
  - Calculate its corresponding bit position in the bit vector.
  - Check if the bit is already set.
    - If yes, the number is a duplicate; print it.
    - If no, mark the bit as set.

### Pseudocode

```python
def find_duplicates(array):
    # Step 1: Initialize a bit vector for numbers 1 to 32,000
    BIT_VECTOR_SIZE = 32000  # Total numbers
    bit_vector = [0] * (BIT_VECTOR_SIZE // 8)  # 1 byte = 8 bits

    # Step 2: Process the array to find duplicates
    for num in array:
        bit_index = num - 1  # Map number to zero-based index
        byte_index = bit_index // 8  # Locate the byte in the array
        bit_offset = bit_index % 8   # Locate the bit within the byte

        # Check if the bit is already set
        if bit_vector[byte_index] & (1 << bit_offset):
            print(f"Duplicate: {num}")  # Number is a duplicate
        else:
            # Mark the bit as set
            bit_vector[byte_index] |= (1 << bit_offset)
```

### Explanation of Key Operations
1. **Mapping Number to Bit Vector**:
   - byte_index = $\lfloor$ (num - 1) / 8 $\rfloor$
   - bit_offset = (num - 1) $\%$ 8
   - Access the specific bit using bitwise operations:
     - Check if the bit is set: `bit_vector[byte_index] & (1 << bit_offset)`
     - Set the bit: `bit_vector[byte_index] |= (1 << bit_offset)`

2. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Each number uses one bit, so \(32,000\) numbers require \(32,000 / 8 = 4,000\) bytes.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - O(n): Iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(4 KB): For the bit vector.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 6]`:
1. Initialize `bit_vector` with all zeros.
2. Process each number:
   - For `1`: Mark bit for `1`.
   - For `2`: Mark bit for `2`.
   - For `3`: Mark bit for `3`.
   - For `2`: Bit already set → Print `Duplicate: 2`.
   - For `5`: Mark bit for `5`.
   - For `3`: Bit already set → Print `Duplicate: 3`.
   - For `6`: Mark bit for `6`.

Output:
```
Duplicate: 2
Duplicate: 3
```
