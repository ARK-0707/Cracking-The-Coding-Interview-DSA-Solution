# 10.7 Missing Int

## Problem Description
Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer that is not 
contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need an algorithm that identifies an integer not in the file using limited memory (1 GB). Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Key Insights
1. **Range of Integers**: Non-negative integers range from 0 to $`2^{32} - 1`$, a total of $`2^{32}`$ possible values ($\approx$ 4.3 x $`10^9`$).
2. **Memory Constraints**: With 1GB = $`2^{30}`$ bytes available, we can allocate a bit array of size $`2^{30}`$ x 8 = $`2^{33}`$ bits, enough to represent $`2^{32}`$ integers with a single bit for each.
3. **Bit Array**: Use a bit array to track which integers are present in the file. Each bit in the array corresponds to one integer.

### Algorithm

#### **Step 1: Initialize a Bit Array**
- Allocate a bit array of size $`2^{32}`$ bits or $`2^{32}`$ / 8 = 512 MB.
- Initially, set all bits to `0`.

#### **Step 2: Process the File**
- Read the file in chunks (if necessary) and mark the corresponding bit for each integer in the file.
  - For an integer \(x\), set the bit at index \(x\) in the bit array to `1`.

#### **Step 3: Find a Missing Integer**
- Scan through the bit array to find the first index \(i\) where the bit is `0`.
- The integer \(i\) is not in the file.

### Pseudocode

```python
# Constants
BIT_ARRAY_SIZE = 2**32 // 8  # Size of the bit array in bytes

# Step 1: Initialize bit array
bit_array = [0] * (BIT_ARRAY_SIZE)  # Each element is a byte (8 bits)

# Step 2: Process the file
with open("input_file", "rb") as file:
    while (chunk := file.read(4096)):  # Read file in chunks
        for number in chunk:  # Assume file contains binary representation of integers
            byte_index = number // 8
            bit_index = number % 8
            bit_array[byte_index] |= (1 << bit_index)  # Mark the bit as '1'

# Step 3: Find the missing integer
for i in range(len(bit_array)):
    for j in range(8):  # Check each bit in the byte
        if not (bit_array[i] & (1 << j)):
            missing_number = i * 8 + j
            print("Missing number:", missing_number)
            exit()
```

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Reading the file: O(n), where n is the number of integers in the file ($\approx$4 billion).
  - Scanning the bit array: (O($`2^{32}`$ / 8) = O($`2^{29}`$).
- **Space Complexity**: $`(2^{32} / 8 = 512`$MB) for the bit array.

### Alternative Approach (If Memory is More Constrained)
If you canâ€™t allocate a full bit array:
1. Divide the range into smaller chunks e.g., $`2^{30}`$.
2. Count the occurrences of integers in each chunk using a smaller bit array.
3. Identify a chunk with missing numbers and repeat the process within that chunk.

This divide-and-conquer approach reduces memory usage but increases I/O operations.
