# 10.1 Sorted Merge

## Problem Description:
You are given two sorted arrays, `A` and `B`, where `A` has a large enough buffer at the end to hold `B`. Write a method to merge `B` into `A` in sorted order.

---

## Approach:

### Using a Three-Pointer Technique:
1. **Pointers**:
   - `lastA`: Tracks the last valid element in array `A` (excluding the buffer).
   - `lastB`: Tracks the last element in array `B`.
   - `lastMerged`: Tracks the index in `A` where the next largest element should be placed.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Start comparing the elements from the end of both arrays (`A` and `B`) to ensure sorted order.
   - Place the larger element at the `lastMerged` position and move the corresponding pointer (`lastA` or `lastB`) backward.

3. **Remaining Elements**:
   - If elements remain in `B`, continue placing them in `A` (this happens when all elements in `A` are already greater than the remaining elements in `B`).

4. **Efficiency**:
   - Since the arrays are already sorted, this approach eliminates the need for additional sorting or temporary arrays.

## Implementation:

```python
def mergeSortedArrays(A, B):
    """
    Merge two sorted arrays, B into A, in sorted order.

    :param A: List[int] - First sorted array with extra space at the end
    :param B: List[int] - Second sorted array
    """
    # Last index of A's actual elements
    lastA = len(A) - len(B) - 1
    # Last index of B
    lastB = len(B) - 1
    # Last index of merged array
    lastMerged = len(A) - 1

    # Merge in reverse order
    while lastB >= 0:
        # Compare elements from the end of A and B
        if lastA >= 0 and A[lastA] > B[lastB]:
            A[lastMerged] = A[lastA]
            lastA -= 1
        else:
            A[lastMerged] = B[lastB]
            lastB -= 1
        lastMerged -= 1

# Example usage
A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
B = [2, 4, 6, 8]
mergeSortedArrays(A, B)
print(A)
```

## Explanation:

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input**:
- `A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `B = [2, 4, 6, 8]`

**Initial Pointers**:
- `lastA = 3` (points to `7`)
- `lastB = 3` (points to `8`)
- `lastMerged = 7` (last index of `A`)

**Steps**:
1. Compare `A[3] (7)` with `B[3] (8)`. Place `8` in `A[7]`.  
   Update: `lastB = 2`, `lastMerged = 6`.

2. Compare `A[3] (7)` with `B[2] (6)`. Place `7` in `A[6]`.  
   Update: `lastA = 2`, `lastMerged = 5`.

3. Compare `A[2] (5)` with `B[2] (6)`. Place `6` in `A[5]`.  
   Update: `lastB = 1`, `lastMerged = 4`.

4. Compare `A[2] (5)` with `B[1] (4)`. Place `5` in `A[4]`.  
   Update: `lastA = 1`, `lastMerged = 3`.

5. Compare `A[1] (3)` with `B[1] (4)`. Place `4` in `A[3]`.  
   Update: `lastB = 0`, `lastMerged = 2`.

6. Compare `A[1] (3)` with `B[0] (2)`. Place `3` in `A[2]`.  
   Update: `lastA = 0`, `lastMerged = 1`.

7. Compare `A[0] (1)` with `B[0] (2)`. Place `2` in `A[1]`.  
   Update: `lastB = -1`, `lastMerged = 0`.

**Final Array**:
- `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

---

## Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Each element of `B` is processed once and compared with elements of `A`.
   - **Complexity**: **O(n + m)**, where n and m are the sizes of `A` and `B`.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The merge is done in-place without using extra space.
   - **Complexity**: **O(1)**.

---

## Output Example:

```python
# Input:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
B = [2, 4, 6, 8]
mergeSortedArrays(A, B)

# Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

---

### Key Points:
- This method efficiently merges two sorted arrays without requiring additional space or modifying the structure of `B`.
- By working from the back, we ensure that the larger elements are placed first, avoiding overwriting elements in `A`.

This approach is optimal for problems involving merging pre-sorted arrays.
