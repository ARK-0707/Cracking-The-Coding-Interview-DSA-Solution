# 10.3 Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem Description:

Given a `sorted array` of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times, write a code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.

---

## Approach:

### Using Modified Binary Search:
1. **Identify Sorted Halves**:
   - Even after rotation, one part of the array will always remain sorted. The algorithm takes advantage of this property.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Compare the middle element (`arr[mid]`) with the target:
     - If `arr[mid] == target`, return the index.
     - Otherwise, check which half of the array is sorted:
       - If the left half is sorted (`arr[left] <= arr[mid]`), check if the target lies within this range:
         - If yes, search in the left half.
         - Otherwise, search in the right half.
       - If the right half is sorted (`arr[mid] <= arr[right]`), check if the target lies within this range:
         - If yes, search in the right half.
         - Otherwise, search in the left half.

3. **Repeat Until Found**:
   - Continue dividing the search space until the target is found or the search space is empty.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If the target is not found, return `-1`.

## Implementation:

```python
def searchRotatedArray(arr, target):
    """
    Search for the target in a rotated sorted array.

    :param arr: List[int] - The rotated sorted array
    :param target: int - The target value to find
    :return: int - Index of the target in the array, or -1 if not found
    """
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        # If the mid element is the target, return its index
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid

        # Determine which half is sorted
        if arr[left] <= arr[mid]:  # Left half is sorted
            if arr[left] <= target < arr[mid]:  # Target lies in the left half
                right = mid - 1
            else:  # Target lies in the right half
                left = mid + 1
        else:  # Right half is sorted
            if arr[mid] < target <= arr[right]:  # Target lies in the right half
                left = mid + 1
            else:  # Target lies in the left half
                right = mid - 1

    # If target is not found
    return -1


# Example Usage
rotated_array = [6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
result = searchRotatedArray(rotated_array, target)
print(f"Target {target} is at index: {result}")
```

## Explanation:

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input**:
```python
rotated_array = [6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
```

**Steps**:
1. **Initial Indices**:
   - `left = 0, right = 7`.
   - `mid = (0 + 7) // 2 = 3`, so `arr[mid] = 1`.

2. **Compare Target**:
   - `target (3) > arr[mid] (1)`:
     - The right half (`arr[mid]` to `arr[right]`) is sorted (`1 to 5`).
     - `3` lies in the right half (`mid + 1` to `right`).

3. **Next Search**:
   - Update indices: `left = 4, right = 7`.
   - `mid = (4 + 7) // 2 = 5`, so `arr[mid] = 3`.

4. **Target Found**:
   - `arr[mid] == target`.
   - Return `mid = 5`.

---

## Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Each step reduces the search space by half.
   - **Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the size of the array.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - No additional space is used.
   - **Complexity**: O(1).

---

## Output Example:

**Input**:
```python
rotated_array = [6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 3
```

**Output**:
```python
Target 3 is at index: 5
```

### Key Points:
- The algorithm leverages the sorted property of either half of the rotated array.
- Handles edge cases like target not found or duplicate elements.
- Efficient for large arrays due to O(log n) complexity.
