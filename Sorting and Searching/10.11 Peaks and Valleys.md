# 10.11 Peaks and Valleys

## Problem Description:
In an array of integers, a `"peak"` is an element that is `greater than or equal to the adjacent integers`, and a `"valley"` is an element that is `less than or equal to the adjacent integers`. For example, in the array `{5, 8, 6, 2, 3, 4, 6}`, `{8, 6}` are peaks and `{5, 2}` are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.

### Example

**Inputs:**
```
Input: {5, 3, 1, 2, 3}
```

**Output:**
```
Output: {5, 1, 3, 2, 3}
```

## Approach:
1. **Observation**:
   - Peaks occur at even indices (0, 2, 4,$`\ldots`$).
   - Valleys occur at odd indices (\(1, 3, 5,$`\ldots`$).

2. **Strategy**:
   - Traverse the array, and for each index, compare it with its neighbors:
     - For **even indices** (peaks), ensure the element is greater than or equal to its neighbors.
     - For **odd indices** (valleys), ensure the element is less than or equal to its neighbors.
   - Swap elements with neighbors to maintain the alternating sequence.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - This approach runs in **O(n)** time, as we traverse the array once.

## Implementation:

```python
def peaks_and_valleys(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Determine the maximum value among the current and adjacent elements
        largest_index = i
        if i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[largest_index]:
            largest_index = i - 1
        if i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i + 1] > arr[largest_index]:
            largest_index = i + 1

        # Swap if the current index is not the largest
        if i % 2 == 0:  # For peaks, current index must have the largest value
            if largest_index != i:
                arr[i], arr[largest_index] = arr[largest_index], arr[i]

    return arr


# Example usage
input_array = [5, 3, 1, 2, 3]
output = peaks_and_valleys(input_array)
print(output)  # Output: [5, 1, 3, 2, 3]
```

## Example Walkthrough:

### Input:
```python
input_array = [5, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

### Execution:
1. Start with the first element (`i = 0`, peak):
   - Compare `5` with its right neighbor `3`: no change.
2. Move to the second element (`i = 1`, valley):
   - Compare `3` with its left `5` and right `1`: swap `3` with `1`.
3. Continue this pattern for the entire array.

### Output:
```plaintext
[5, 1, 3, 2, 3]
```

## Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - O(n), as each element is visited once.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - O(1), since the sorting is done in place.

## Output:

**Input**:
```python
[5, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```

**Output**:
```plaintext
[5, 1, 3, 2, 3]
```
