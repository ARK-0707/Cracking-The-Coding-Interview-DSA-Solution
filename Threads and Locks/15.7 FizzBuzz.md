# 15.7 FizzBuzz

## Probelem Description
In the classic problem `FizzBuzz`, you are told to print the numbers from `1` to `n`. However, when the number is divisible by `3`, print `"Fizz"`. When it is divisible by `5`, print `"Buzz"`. When it divisible by `3` and `5`, print `"FizzBuzz"`. In this problem, you are asked to do this in a `multithreaded` way. Implement a multithreaded version of FizzBuzz with `four threads`. One thread checks for divisibility of `3` and prints `"Fizz"`. Another thread is responsible for divisibility of `5` and prints `"Buzz"`. A third thread is responsible for divisibility of `3` and `5` and prints `"FizzBuzz"`. A fourth thread does the numbers.

## **Implementation Details**
To achieve synchronization between threads, we use Python's **threading** module along with **condition variables** to ensure threads operate in the correct sequence.

## **Code**

```python
from threading import Thread, Condition


class FizzBuzz:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.current = 1
        self.condition = Condition()

    def fizz(self, printFizz):
        while True:
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and (self.current % 3 != 0 or self.current % 5 == 0):
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current > self.n:
                    self.condition.notify_all()
                    break
                printFizz()
                self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()

    def buzz(self, printBuzz):
        while True:
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and (self.current % 5 != 0 or self.current % 3 == 0):
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current > self.n:
                    self.condition.notify_all()
                    break
                printBuzz()
                self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()

    def fizzbuzz(self, printFizzBuzz):
        while True:
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and self.current % 15 != 0:
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current > self.n:
                    self.condition.notify_all()
                    break
                printFizzBuzz()
                self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()

    def number(self, printNumber):
        while True:
            with self.condition:
                while self.current <= self.n and (self.current % 3 == 0 or self.current % 5 == 0):
                    self.condition.wait()
                if self.current > self.n:
                    self.condition.notify_all()
                    break
                printNumber(self.current)
                self.current += 1
                self.condition.notify_all()


def printFizz():
    print("Fizz", end=" ")


def printBuzz():
    print("Buzz", end=" ")


def printFizzBuzz():
    print("FizzBuzz", end=" ")


def printNumber(num):
    print(num, end=" ")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 15
    fizzbuzz = FizzBuzz(n)

    thread1 = Thread(target=fizzbuzz.fizz, args=(printFizz,))
    thread2 = Thread(target=fizzbuzz.buzz, args=(printBuzz,))
    thread3 = Thread(target=fizzbuzz.fizzbuzz, args=(printFizzBuzz,))
    thread4 = Thread(target=fizzbuzz.number, args=(printNumber,))

    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()
    thread3.start()
    thread4.start()

    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()
    thread3.join()
    thread4.join()
```

## **Explanation**

### **Class Implementation**
1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - `self.n`: Upper limit for FizzBuzz.
   - `self.current`: Tracks the current number being processed.
   - `self.condition`: A `Condition` object to handle thread synchronization.

2. **Methods**:
   - **`fizz`**: Prints `"Fizz"` for numbers divisible by 3 but not 5.
   - **`buzz`**: Prints `"Buzz"` for numbers divisible by 5 but not 3.
   - **`fizzbuzz`**: Prints `"FizzBuzz"` for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
   - **`number`**: Prints the numbers not divisible by 3 or 5.

3. **Synchronization**:
   - Each method uses `Condition.wait()` to block until it's the thread's turn.
   - `Condition.notify_all()` wakes up all waiting threads.

### **Threads**
- Four threads are created, each calling one of the `FizzBuzz` methods.
- Threads execute concurrently, but synchronization ensures correct order.

---

## **Output**
For `n = 15`, the output is:
```
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 
```

---

## **Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the upper limit. Each number is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` additional space, apart from threads and synchronization objects.

---

This implementation effectively uses multithreading to solve the FizzBuzz problem while maintaining correct synchronization and sequencing between threads.
