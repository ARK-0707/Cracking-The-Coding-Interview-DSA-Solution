# 15.5 Call In Order

## Problem Description
Suppose we have the following code:

```java
public class Foo {
  public Foo() { ... }
  public void first() { ... }
  public void second() { ... }
  public void third() { ... }
}
```

The same instance of `Foo` will be passed to three different threads. `ThreadA` will call first, `ThreadB` will call second, and `ThreadC` will call third. Design a mechanism to ensure that `first` is called before `second` and `second` is called before `third`.

---


### **Implementation Details**
The `Foo` class uses **semaphores** to manage the order of execution. Semaphores allow threads to wait until a signal is received, ensuring synchronization.

#### Key Methods:
1. **`first()`**: Executes without waiting, as it is the first method.
2. **`second()`**: Waits for a signal from `first()` before execution.
3. **`third()`**: Waits for a signal from `second()` before execution.

---

### **Example Usage**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

public class Foo {
    private Semaphore secondSemaphore = new Semaphore(0);
    private Semaphore thirdSemaphore = new Semaphore(0);

    public Foo() {
        // Initialize semaphores
    }

    public void first() {
        System.out.println("first");
        secondSemaphore.release(); // Signal second to proceed
    }

    public void second() {
        try {
            secondSemaphore.acquire(); // Wait for first
            System.out.println("second");
            thirdSemaphore.release(); // Signal third to proceed
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void third() {
        try {
            thirdSemaphore.acquire(); // Wait for second
            System.out.println("third");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Foo foo = new Foo();

        // Create threads for each method
        Thread threadA = new Thread(foo::first);
        Thread threadB = new Thread(foo::second);
        Thread threadC = new Thread(foo::third);

        // Start threads in random order
        threadC.start();
        threadB.start();
        threadA.start();
    }
}
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Two semaphores (`secondSemaphore` and `thirdSemaphore`) are initialized with `0`, ensuring that `second` and `third` will wait until they are signaled.

2. **Thread Synchronization**:
   - `first` executes and signals `second` by releasing `secondSemaphore`.
   - `second` executes after acquiring `secondSemaphore` and signals `third` by releasing `thirdSemaphore`.
   - `third` executes after acquiring `thirdSemaphore`.

3. **Thread Execution**:
   - Even if threads are started in a random order, the semaphores ensure that the methods are executed in the correct order: `first`, `second`, `third`.

---

### **Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Each method executes in `O(1)` time.
  - Semaphore operations (`acquire` and `release`) are also `O(1)`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - `O(1)` additional space is used for the semaphores.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Thread-Safe**: Ensures sequential execution of methods across multiple threads.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Semaphore-based synchronization is lightweight and avoids deadlocks.
- **Robust**: Handles random thread execution order reliably.

This implementation is ideal for scenarios where strict method execution order is critical in multithreaded environments.
