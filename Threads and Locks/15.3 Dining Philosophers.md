# 15.3 Dining Philosophers

## Problem Description
In the famous `dining philosophers` problem, a bunch of philosophers are sitting around a `circular table` with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the `left chopstick before the right one`. A deadlock could potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using `threads and locks`, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that `prevents deadlocks`.

The **Dining Philosophers Problem** is a classic synchronization problem that demonstrates potential pitfalls of concurrent resource sharing, such as **deadlock** and **starvation**. 


#### **Description**

1. **Setup**:
   - Five philosophers sit around a circular table.
   - A chopstick is placed between each pair of philosophers.
   - Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating.
   - A philosopher must pick up both the left and right chopsticks to eat. After eating, they put both chopsticks back down.

2. **Challenges**:
   - If all philosophers pick up their left chopsticks simultaneously, they will all wait for the right chopstick, leading to a **deadlock**.
   - Ensuring fairness to avoid **starvation**, where a philosopher may wait indefinitely.

Each philosopher shares a chopstick with their left and right neighbors.

---

### **Solution**

To prevent deadlock, introduce an **ordering constraint**:
- Number the chopsticks (e.g., 0 to 4).
- Philosophers pick up the lower-numbered chopstick first.
  - Example: If Philosopher 4's left chopstick is 4 and right chopstick is 0, they will pick up chopstick 0 first.
- This breaks the circular waiting condition, ensuring at least one philosopher can proceed.

### **Code Implementation**

Hereâ€™s a Python simulation using `threads` and `locks`:

```python
import threading
import time
import random

# Number of philosophers
NUM_PHILOSOPHERS = 5

# Locks for chopsticks
chopsticks = [threading.Lock() for _ in range(NUM_PHILOSOPHERS)]

def philosopher(philosopher_id):
    left = philosopher_id  # Left chopstick index
    right = (philosopher_id + 1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS  # Right chopstick index

    # Ensure order to prevent deadlock
    first, second = (left, right) if left < right else (right, left)

    while True:
        print(f"Philosopher {philosopher_id} is thinking.")
        time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))  # Thinking time

        print(f"Philosopher {philosopher_id} is hungry.")
        
        # Acquire chopsticks in order
        with chopsticks[first]:
            with chopsticks[second]:
                print(f"Philosopher {philosopher_id} is eating.")
                time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 2))  # Eating time
                
        print(f"Philosopher {philosopher_id} finished eating.")

# Create threads for philosophers
philosopher_threads = [
    threading.Thread(target=philosopher, args=(i,))
    for i in range(NUM_PHILOSOPHERS)
]

# Start all threads
for thread in philosopher_threads:
    thread.start()

# Join all threads (optional for continuous simulation)
for thread in philosopher_threads:
    thread.join()
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Chopstick Locking**:
   - Each chopstick is represented by a `threading.Lock`.
   - Locks ensure mutual exclusion, so only one philosopher can use a chopstick at a time.

2. **Order Enforcement**:
   - To prevent deadlock, philosophers acquire chopsticks in a fixed order: always pick the lower-numbered chopstick first.

3. **Thinking and Eating**:
   - Philosophers alternate between thinking (simulated by sleeping) and eating (requiring both chopsticks).

4. **Thread Safety**:
   - Using `with` ensures locks are released automatically, even if exceptions occur.

---

### **Complexity**

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Each philosopher spends time thinking (`O(1)`) and eating (`O(1)`).
   - Total simulation runtime depends on the number of iterations and randomness.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - `O(N)` for chopsticks (locks) and threads.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Enforced by acquiring locks in a specific order.
- **Fairness**: Each philosopher eventually gets to eat due to lock release mechanisms.
