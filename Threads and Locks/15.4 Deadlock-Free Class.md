# 15.4 Deadlock-Free Class

## Problem Description
Design a class which provides a lock only if there are no possible deadlocks.

---

### **Implementation Details**
The `DeadlockFreeLock` class manages locks and their acquisition order. Each thread attempting to acquire a lock must do so in a globally consistent manner.

Key methods:
- **`acquire(thread_id, lock_id)`**: Attempts to acquire a lock for a thread. Ensures deadlock-free ordering.
- **`release(thread_id, lock_id)`**: Releases a lock held by a thread.
- **`_can_acquire(thread_id, lock_id)`**: Internal method to check if acquiring the lock would cause a deadlock.

---

### **Example Usage**

```python
from threading import Thread, Lock
import time

class DeadlockFreeLock:
    def __init__(self, num_locks):
        self.locks = [Lock() for _ in range(num_locks)]  # Create the required locks
        self.lock_order = {}  # Tracks which locks are held by which thread

    def acquire(self, thread_id, lock_id):
        if not self._can_acquire(thread_id, lock_id):
            raise Exception(f"Thread {thread_id} cannot acquire Lock {lock_id} due to potential deadlock")
        
        self.locks[lock_id].acquire()
        self.lock_order[(thread_id, lock_id)] = time.time()  # Record lock acquisition time
        print(f"Thread {thread_id} acquired Lock {lock_id}.")

    def release(self, thread_id, lock_id):
        if (thread_id, lock_id) in self.lock_order:
            self.locks[lock_id].release()
            del self.lock_order[(thread_id, lock_id)]
            print(f"Thread {thread_id} released Lock {lock_id}.")
        else:
            raise Exception(f"Thread {thread_id} does not hold Lock {lock_id}")

    def _can_acquire(self, thread_id, lock_id):
        # Check if acquiring this lock violates global ordering
        for (tid, lid), _ in self.lock_order.items():
            if tid != thread_id and lid < lock_id:
                return False
        return True

# Simulation of threads acquiring and releasing locks
def thread_function(thread_id, lock_manager):
    try:
        lock_manager.acquire(thread_id, 0)
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate work
        lock_manager.acquire(thread_id, 1)
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate work
        lock_manager.release(thread_id, 1)
        lock_manager.release(thread_id, 0)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lock_manager = DeadlockFreeLock(num_locks=3)

    threads = [
        Thread(target=thread_function, args=(0, lock_manager)),
        Thread(target=thread_function, args=(1, lock_manager)),
    ]

    for t in threads:
        t.start()
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Locks**:
   - Each resource (lock) is represented by a `Lock` object.
   - Locks are ordered globally, and threads acquire them in a consistent order.

2. **Deadlock Avoidance**:
   - **Ordering**: Threads acquire locks in ascending order. For example, Lock 0 is acquired before Lock 1.
   - **Check Before Acquiring**: Before acquiring a lock, the `_can_acquire` method ensures that doing so will not lead to circular waiting.

3. **Thread Functionality**:
   - Threads acquire locks sequentially, perform work, and then release the locks.

4. **Print Statements**:
   - Track the state of each thread and lock during the simulation.

---

### **Complexity**

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Lock Acquisition**: `O(K)`, where K is the number of locks currently held (for checking conflicts).
   - **Release**: `O(1)`, as releasing a lock is constant-time.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - `O(N + K)`, where `N` is the number of threads and `K` is the number of locks.

---

### **Key Features**
- Prevents **deadlock** using global lock ordering.
- Threads can dynamically request locks without risking circular waiting.
- Maintains a balance between concurrency and safety.

This implementation ensures safe, efficient, and deadlock-free lock management suitable for multithreaded applications.
