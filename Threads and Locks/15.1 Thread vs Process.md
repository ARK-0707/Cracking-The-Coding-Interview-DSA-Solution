### Difference Between Thread and Process

| **Aspect**                 | **Thread**                                                                                     | **Process**                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**             | A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.                                 | A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space.                     |
| **Memory Space**           | Shares the memory space and resources of the parent process.                                  | Has its own separate memory space.                                                              |
| **Communication**          | Threads can communicate with each other easily using shared memory.                          | Inter-process communication is more complex and slower, often using mechanisms like pipes or sockets. |
| **Dependency**             | Dependent on the parent process; cannot exist without a process.                             | Independent; can run on its own.                                                                |
| **Context Switching**      | Faster, as threads share the same memory space.                                               | Slower, as each process has its own memory and resources.                                       |
| **Overhead**               | Lower resource overhead since threads share resources of the process.                        | Higher resource overhead due to independent memory and resource allocation.                     |
| **Crash Impact**           | If a thread crashes, it can potentially bring down the entire process.                       | If a process crashes, it doesn't directly affect other processes.                               |
| **Example (Single System)**| In a web server, each thread might handle a single client request.                           | Running multiple programs like a web browser, text editor, and a music player simultaneously.   |
| **Example (Web App)**      | A thread in Next.js might handle server-side rendering for a single user request.             | A process in Horizon might be the server running the Next.js application.                       |
