# 15.6 Synchronized Methods

## Problem Description
You are given a class with `synchronized method A` and a `normal method B`. If you have two threads in one instance of program, can they both execute `A` at the same time? Can they execute `A` and `B` at the time?

---

## **Analysis**

### **Understanding `synchronized` in Java**
- A **synchronized method** acquires a lock on the object (`this`) before it executes. If one thread is executing a synchronized method, other threads attempting to call any synchronized method on the same object must wait.
- A **normal method** does not require any lock, so it can be executed concurrently with other methods, including synchronized methods.

---

### **Scenarios**
1. **Two threads trying to execute `A`:**
   - **Result**: Not possible. The first thread acquires the lock on the object, blocking the second thread until the lock is released.

2. **One thread executing `A` and another executing `B`:**
   - **Result**: Possible. Since `B` is not synchronized, it does not require a lock, and can execute concurrently with `A`.

## **Example Code**

```java
public class SynchronizedExample {
    public synchronized void methodA() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " entered methodA");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " exiting methodA");
    }

    public void methodB() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " entered methodB");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " exiting methodB");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SynchronizedExample example = new SynchronizedExample();

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> example.methodA(), "Thread-1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> example.methodA(), "Thread-2");
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(() -> example.methodB(), "Thread-3");

        thread1.start(); // Calls methodA
        thread2.start(); // Calls methodA
        thread3.start(); // Calls methodB
    }
}
```

---

## **Explanation**

1. **Thread 1 and Thread 2:**
   - Both call `methodA`, but only one thread can execute it at a time because `methodA` is synchronized and locks the object.

2. **Thread 3:**
   - Calls `methodB`, which does not require a lock. It can execute concurrently with either `Thread 1` or `Thread 2`.

---

## **Output Example**

```plaintext
Thread-1 entered methodA
Thread-3 entered methodB
Thread-3 exiting methodB
Thread-1 exiting methodA
Thread-2 entered methodA
Thread-2 exiting methodA
```

---

## **Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**:
  - `methodA`: `O(T)`, where `T` is the time taken for its execution.
  - `methodB`: `O(T')`, where `T'` is the time taken for its execution.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - `O(1)`, as no additional space is used aside from method parameters.

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Synchronized Methods**:
   - Only one thread can execute a synchronized method on the same object at a time.
   - Prevents race conditions on shared resources.

2. **Normal Methods**:
   - Can run concurrently with synchronized methods unless explicitly synchronized.

This demonstrates the behavior of `synchronized` and normal methods in multithreaded programs effectively.
