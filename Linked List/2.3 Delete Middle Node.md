# 2.3 Delete Middle Node

## Description
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

**Example**

Given a linked list:
```
a --> b --> c --> d --> e --> f
```

Deleting node 'c' results in:
```
a --> b --> d --> e --> f
```

## Explanation
The `LinkedList` class provides a method `deleteNode` to delete a specified node from the linked list. To delete the node, the method copies the data from the next node into the current node and then updates the current node's `next` pointer to skip the next node, effectively removing it from the list.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `deleteNode` method is 𝑂(1), which is constant time. This is because the method performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the linked list.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the `deleteNode` method is 𝑂(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space.

### Python Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def print(self):
        if self.head is None:
            print("Linked List is empty")
            return
        itr = self.head
        llstr = ""
        while itr:
            llstr += '-->' + str(itr.data)
            itr = itr.next
        print(llstr)

    def insertAtEnd(self, data):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(data, None)
            return self.head  # Return the newly inserted node

        itr = self.head
        while itr.next:
            itr = itr.next

        new_node = Node(data, None)
        itr.next = new_node
        return new_node  # Return the newly inserted node

    def deleteNode(self, node):
        if node is None or node.next is None:
            return False  # Cannot delete the last node or if node is None

        next_node = node.next
        node.data = next_node.data
        node.next = next_node.next
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ll = LinkedList()
    node_a = ll.insertAtEnd("a")
    node_b = ll.insertAtEnd("b")
    node_c = ll.insertAtEnd("c")
    node_d = ll.insertAtEnd("d")
    node_e = ll.insertAtEnd("e")
    node_f = ll.insertAtEnd("f")

    print("Original Linked List:")
    ll.print()

    # Delete node 'c'
    ll.deleteNode(node_c)

    print("\nLinked List after deleting node 'c':")
    ll.print()
```

This implementation of the linked list class effectively demonstrates how to delete a node from the middle of the list given only access to that node, maintaining the integrity of the list structure and ensuring efficient time and space complexity.
