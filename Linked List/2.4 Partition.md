# 2.4 Partition

## Description
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

**Example**

Given a linked list:
```
3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1
```
Partitioning around value 5 results in:
```
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10
```

## Explanation
The `partition` function partitions the linked list around a given value x. The algorithm creates two separate lists: one for nodes with values less than x and one for nodes with values greater than or equal to x. These lists are then combined to form the final partitioned list.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `partition` function is 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the method involves a single traversal of the list.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the `partition` function is 𝑂(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space for the pointers and dummy nodes.

### Python Code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def partition(head, x):
    less_head = ListNode(0)
    greater_head = ListNode(0)

    less = less_head
    greater = greater_head

    current = head
    while current:
        if current.val < x:
            less.next = current
            less = less.next
        else:
            greater.next = current
            greater = greater.next
        current = current.next

    # Terminate the greater list to avoid a cycle in the linked list
    greater.next = None
    # Connect the less list with the greater list
    less.next = greater_head.next

    return less_head.next

# Helper function to create a linked list from a list
def create_linked_list(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    current = head
    for value in arr[1:]:
        current.next = ListNode(value)
        current = current.next
    return head

# Helper function to print a linked list
def print_linked_list(head):
    elements = []
    while head:
        elements.append(str(head.val))
        head = head.next
    print("->".join(elements))

# Example usage
arr = [3, 5, 8, 5, 10, 2, 1]
x = 5
head = create_linked_list(arr)
print("Original list:")
print_linked_list(head)

new_head = partition(head, x)
print("Partitioned list:")
print_linked_list(new_head)
```

This implementation of the `partition` function effectively partitions a linked list around a specified value while maintaining the integrity of the list structure and ensuring efficient time and space complexity. The helper functions `create_linked_list` and `print_linked_list` facilitate testing and demonstration of the `partition` function.
