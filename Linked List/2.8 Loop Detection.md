# 2.8 Circular Linked List

## Description
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop. A circular linked list is a (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, making a loop in the linked list.

**Example**

Input:
```
A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C     [the same C as earlier]
```
Output:
```
C
```

### Explanation
The `detect_cycle` function identifies the start of the loop in a circular linked list. It uses Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, to detect the cycle. Once a cycle is detected, it resets one pointer to the head and moves both pointers at the same pace to find the start of the loop.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of nodes in the linked list. This includes traversing the list to detect the cycle and finding the start of the loop.
- **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(1), as only a few extra variables are used.

### Python Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def print(self):
        if self.head is None:
            print("Linked List is empty")
            return
        itr = self.head
        llstr = ""

        while itr:
            llstr += '-->' + str(itr.data)
            itr = itr.next
            # To avoid infinite loop in case of circular linked list
            if len(llstr) > 100:
                llstr += "-->..."
                break
        print(llstr)

    def insertAtEnd(self, data):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(data, None)
            return

        itr = self.head
        while itr.next:
            itr = itr.next

        itr.next = Node(data, None)

    def insertValues(self, data_list):
        self.head = None
        for data in data_list:
            self.insertAtEnd(data)

    def createLoop(self, pos):
        if pos == -1:
            return
        loop_start = None
        itr = self.head
        index = 0
        prev = None
        while itr:
            if index == pos:
                loop_start = itr
            prev = itr
            itr = itr.next
            index += 1
        if prev:
            prev.next = loop_start


def detect_cycle(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head

    # Detect if there is a cycle
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            break

    # No cycle
    if not fast or not fast.next:
        return None

    # Find the start of the cycle
    slow = head
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    return slow


if __name__ == '__main__':
    ll = LinkedList()
    ll.insertValues(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])

    # Create a loop (C points back to the 3rd node, which is 'C')
    ll.createLoop(2)

    ll.print()

    loop_node = detect_cycle(ll.head)
    if loop_node:
        print(f"The node at the beginning of the loop is: {loop_node.data}")
    else:
        print("No loop detected.")
```

The implementation of the `detect_cycle` function effectively identifies the start of the loop in a circular linked list using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm. The `LinkedList` class supports operations such as insertion, printing, and creating loops, facilitating the creation and manipulation of linked lists for testing purposes.
