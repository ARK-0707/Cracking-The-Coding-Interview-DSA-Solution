# 2.7 Intersection

## Description
Given two singly linked lists, determine if the two linked lists intersect and return the intersecting node. The intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second list, then they intersect.

**Example**

Given two linked lists:
```
List A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
                    ↘
                     5 -> 6 -> 7
                    ↗
List B:      9 -> 8
```
The intersecting node is the node with value `5`.

### Explanation
The `get_intersection_node` function determines if two linked lists intersect and returns the intersecting node. It first calculates the lengths of both lists, aligns the starts of the lists by advancing the pointer of the longer list by the difference in lengths, and then traverses both lists in tandem to find the intersection.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 𝑂(𝑛 + 𝑚), where 𝑛 and 𝑚 are the lengths of the two linked lists. This includes calculating the lengths and traversing the lists.
- **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(1), as only a few extra variables are used.

### Python Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def print(self):
        if self.head is None:
            print("Linked List is empty")
            return
        itr = self.head
        llstr = ""

        while itr:
            llstr += '-->' + str(itr.data)
            itr = itr.next
        print(llstr)

    def insertAtEnd(self, data):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(data, None)
            return

        itr = self.head
        while itr.next:
            itr = itr.next

        itr.next = Node(data, None)

    def insertValues(self, data_list):
        self.head = None
        for data in data_list:
            self.insertAtEnd(data)

    def getLength(self):
        length = 0
        itr = self.head
        while itr:
            length += 1
            itr = itr.next
        return length


def get_intersection_node(headA, headB):
    lenA = get_length(headA)
    lenB = get_length(headB)

    # Align the start of the longer list with the shorter one
    while lenA > lenB:
        headA = headA.next
        lenA -= 1
    while lenB > lenA:
        headB = headB.next
        lenB -= 1

    # Traverse together until intersection or end
    while headA and headB:
        if headA == headB:
            return headA
        headA = headA.next
        headB = headB.next

    return None

def get_length(head):
    length = 0
    while head:
        length += 1
        head = head.next
    return length


if __name__ == '__main__':
    llA = LinkedList()
    llA.insertValues([1, 2])

    llB = LinkedList()
    llB.insertValues([3, 4])

    # Create intersection
    intersecting_node = Node(5)
    llA.head.next.next = intersecting_node
    llB.head.next.next = intersecting_node

    intersecting_node.next = Node(6)
    intersecting_node.next.next = Node(7)

    # Print linked lists
    llA.print()
    llB.print()

    # Find intersection
    intersection = get_intersection_node(llA.head, llB.head)
    if intersection:
        print(f"The intersecting node data is: {intersection.data}")
    else:
        print("The linked lists do not intersect.")
```

The implementation of the `get_intersection_node` function effectively identifies the intersection point of two linked lists by aligning the starting points of the two lists and then traversing them simultaneously to find the intersecting node. The `LinkedList` class supports operations such as insertion and printing, facilitating the creation and manipulation of linked lists for testing purposes.
