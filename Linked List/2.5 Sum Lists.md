# 2.5 Sum Lists

## Description
You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

**Example**

Given two linked lists:
```
(7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)
```
which represent numbers 617 and 295 respectively.

Adding them gives:
```
2 -> 1 -> 9
```
which represents the number 912.

**FOLLOW UP**

Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.

**Example**

Given two linked lists:
```
(7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)
```
which represent numbers 617 and 295 respectively.

Adding them gives:
```
1-> 3 -> 0 -> 8
```
which represents the number 1308.

### Explanation
The `add_two_numbers_reverse_order` function takes two linked lists where digits of two numbers are stored in reverse order and computes their sum by iterating through both lists simultaneously, handling carries appropriately. It returns the sum as a new linked list.

The `add_two_numbers_forward_order` function first reverses both input linked lists to utilize the `add_two_numbers_reverse_order` function to compute the sum in reverse order. After computing the sum, it reverses the result to obtain the final sum in the forward order.

#### Complexity

*Reverse Order*
- **Time Complexity**: 𝑂(max(𝑚, 𝑛)), where 𝑚 and 𝑛 are the lengths of the two input linked lists.
- **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(max(𝑚, 𝑛)), additional space used for the output linked list.

*Forward Order*

- **Time Complexity**: 𝑂(max(𝑚, 𝑛)), where 𝑚 and 𝑛 are the lengths of the two input linked lists.
- **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(max(𝑚, 𝑛)), additional space used for the output linked list.

### Python Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, head=None):
        self.head = head

    def print(self):
        if self.head is None:
            print("Linked List is empty")
            return
        itr = self.head
        llstr = ""

        while itr:
            llstr += '-->' + str(itr.data)
            itr = itr.next
        print(llstr)

    def insertAtEnd(self, data):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(data, None)
            return

        itr = self.head
        while itr.next:
            itr = itr.next

        itr.next = Node(data, None)

    def insertValues(self, data_list):
        self.head = None
        for data in data_list:
            self.insertAtEnd(data)

    def reverse(self):
        prev = None
        current = self.head
        while current:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_node
        self.head = prev

    def get_head(self):
        return self.head


def add_two_numbers_reverse_order(l1, l2):
    result_head = Node()
    current = result_head
    carry = 0
    p1, p2 = l1.head, l2.head

    while p1 or p2 or carry:
        sum_val = carry
        if p1:
            sum_val += p1.data
            p1 = p1.next
        if p2:
            sum_val += p2.data
            p2 = p2.next

        carry = sum_val // 10
        sum_val %= 10

        current.next = Node(sum_val)
        current = current.next

    return LinkedList(result_head.next)


def add_two_numbers_forward_order(l1, l2):
    l1.reverse()
    l2.reverse()

    result_head = Node()
    current = result_head
    carry = 0
    p1, p2 = l1.get_head(), l2.get_head()

    while p1 or p2 or carry:
        sum_val = carry
        if p1:
            sum_val += p1.data
            p1 = p1.next
        if p2:
            sum_val += p2.data
            p2 = p2.next

        carry = sum_val // 10
        sum_val %= 10

        current.next = Node(sum_val)
        current = current.next

    result_linked_list = LinkedList()
    result_linked_list.head = result_head.next
    result_linked_list.reverse()  # Reverse back to get the correct order

    return result_linked_list


if __name__ == '__main__':
    l1 = LinkedList()
    l1.insertValues([7, 1, 6])
    l1.print()

    l2 = LinkedList()
    l2.insertValues([5, 9, 2])
    l2.print()

    result = add_two_numbers_reverse_order(l1, l2)
    result.print()

    result = add_two_numbers_forward_order(l1, l2)
    result.print()
```

The implementation of the `add_two_numbers_reverse_order` & `add_two_numbers_forward_order` functions effectively computes the sum of two numbers represented as linked lists where digits are in reverse order & forward order respectively. The `LinkedList` class supports operations such as insertion, printing, and reversing, facilitating the creation and manipulation of linked lists for testing purposes.
