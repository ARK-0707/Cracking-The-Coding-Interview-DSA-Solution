# 2.2 Return Kth to Last

## Description
Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

**Example**

Given a linked list:
```
1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5
```

Finding the 2nd to last element should return:
```
4
```

## Explanation
The `LinkedList` class provides a method `KtoLast` to find the kth to last element in the linked list. The method uses two pointers. The first pointer is moved k nodes ahead in the list, and then both pointers are moved simultaneously until the first pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the second pointer will be at the kth to last element.

### Complexity
#### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the `KtoLast` method is 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the method involves a single traversal of the list.

#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the `KtoLast` method is 𝑂(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers.

### Python Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data=None, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def print(self):
        if self.head is None:
            print("Linked List is empty")
            return
        itr = self.head
        llstr = ""
        while itr:
            llstr += '-->' + str(itr.data)
            itr = itr.next
        print(llstr)

    def insertAtEnd(self, data):
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(data, None)
            return
        itr = self.head
        while itr.next:
            itr = itr.next
        itr.next = Node(data, None)

    def KtoLast(self, k):
        # Initialize first and second pointers
        first = second = self.head

        # Move first pointer to the kth node from the start
        for _ in range(k):
            if not first:
                return None  # K is larger than the number of nodes
            first = first.next

        # Move both pointers until the first pointer reaches the end
        while first:
            first = first.next
            second = second.next

        # Now, the second pointer is at the kth to last element
        return second

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ll = LinkedList()
    ll.insertAtEnd(1)
    ll.insertAtEnd(2)
    ll.insertAtEnd(3)
    ll.insertAtEnd(4)
    ll.insertAtEnd(5)
    ll.print()
    k = 2
    result = ll.KtoLast(k)
    if result:
        print(f"The {k}-th to last element is {result.data}")
    else:
        print("The list is too short.")
```

By following this structure, the linked list class can effectively find the kth to last element, providing a clear understanding of its process and complexity.
